  "[6025_LORE_1]": "Dryads can be found in many forests throughout Krystara, even as far as the Underworld. Each Dryad has a tree to which she is bound. Dryads live for many centuries - their existence is tied to their tree, though they can exist outside of it for a time.",
  "[6025_LORE_2]": "Often, when older Dryads have talked with their tree for centuries, it slowly becomes sentient and is known as a Treant. Many of the trees in the Forest of Thorns are over a thousand years old, they have been awake for centuries - they can move and converse quite freely.",
  "[6025_LORE_3]": "On rare occasions a Dryad may leave her tree. This can be traumatic for both the tree and the Dryad, and the tree will often rot and die. If, on the other hand, a Dryad’s tree is cut down, she must find a new tree, or she will surely wither away.",
  "[6061_LORE_1]": "Frost Giants are not known for their incredible grasp on polite civility. But, every so often, a Frost Giant is born who is so unhinged and violent that his career choices are limited to one thing: Berserker. Even other Frost Giants - a generally disagreeable folk - will avoid disputes with their mad kinsfolk.",
  "[6061_LORE_2]": "Once a Frost Giant is identified as a violent axe-murdering maniac, conventional Stormheim wisdom is to ship them as far north as possible to the kingdom of Hyndla Frostcrown, where their savage tendencies are honed by the Berserker King, Grimborn Bloodeye.",
  "[6061_LORE_3]": "Grimborn’s Berserkers are mercenaries, available to any Giant clan who can meet their price. Unfortunately their method of pricing is as inconsistent as their warriors. It might range from a thousand barrels of ale, to a rare magical artifact, depending on Grimborn’s mood at the time.",
  "[6082_LORE_1]": "There are many races of Dwarves in Krystara, and all of them have great crafting skills. Perhaps the most fine-tuned skills of all are those of the Tinker Dwarves such as Sparkgrinder. Tinker Dwarves can be found throughout Krystara, but the largest group of them live in Adana.",
  "[6082_LORE_2]": "Sparkgrinder, like most of his kin, has a brilliant mind and cunning hands, tempered with no trace of common sense or morality whatsoever. Some of his inventions have been miraculous, while others have, at times, left him in breach of the law and in dire trouble with the Adanian College of Engineers.",
  "[6082_LORE_3]": "Despite the trouble he has caused over his long lifespan, the Adanian college allows him to live in his private junkyard on the outskirts of the capital city of New Adania. Within that huge pile of scrap, he and his adopted human daughter, Ghiralee, can always be found working on some strange new project.",
  "[6104_LORE_1]": "If you travel deep into the forests of Pan’s Vale, you might be unfortunate enough to encounter the Fey trickster known as Sylvasi. He tends to lurk in some of the darkest, most overgrown parts of the woods, just waiting for unwary travelers to pass by.  Frequently he’ll wait until they’re distracted or asleep before he pounces.",
  "[6104_LORE_2]": "Sylvasi seldom kills his prey. He delights in a form of mischief that is more cruel than a swift death from his double blades could ever be; he likes to steal your weapons. By itself, that is ill-mannered and simply rude, but once you’re unarmed, he will climb up into the trees and make a racket to summon the less subtle creatures of the Vale. He then watches the carnage with pure delight.",
  "[6104_LORE_3]": "Many folks wonder where Sylvasi came from, and why he acts like this. It is most likely he is simply an unwanted Fey child, abandoned at birth and now acting out with the unfettered mischievous nature of his people. One thing is for certain though, it’s wise to heed the old adage as you travel through Pan’s Vale: Keep your sword close, and stay in the light.",
  "[6122_LORE_1]": "The Dark Elves, by nature, are solitary creatures, not given to forming large cities or societies like the Humans or Dwarves of Krystara. Dokkalfar is typical of his kind - the fourth child of minor nobility. He had few prospects until he stumbled upon an ancient tome in a ruin predating the Dark Elves’ time in Zhul’Kari. The name of that tome was The Dark Swarm.",
  "[6122_LORE_2]": "The Dark Swarm was in an ancient language. Dokkalfar traveled into Karakoth, where he studied that language until he could begin to decipher the book. It contained all manner of information about spiders - not just regular spiders though, many of the creatures on the tome’s pages came from distant dimensions beyond our own.",
  "[6122_LORE_3]": "Eventually, Dokkalfar’s mastery of the tome, and the spells he found therein, was complete. He returned to Zhul’Kari, where his newfound knowledge proved useful as he murdered his way into the hierarchy of the corrupt Tower of Sorcery. To this day he jealously guards the tome, and few dare to interrupt his deeper studies as he scours its pages for more terrible secrets.",
  "[6210_LORE_1]": "The ancient Empire of Khet, long before it crumbled, was home to many cults. Two of the most powerful cults were the Anubites and the Settites, and they were always at war. The Anubites were a death cult, based around the worship of dead ancestors. Their priests created large jackal-like monstrosities to guard their tombs - the Anubite Warriors.",
  "[6210_LORE_2]": "The Settites, on the other hand, worshiped nature in its many guises - in particular the gods of the rivers that brought life to Khet. It was the war between the Anubites and the Settites that eventually brought the entire Kingdom of Khet to its knees. The Anubites destroyed the Settites’ Rivers, creating a drought, and the Settites broke open the Anubites’ Tombs, unleashing a horde of Undead upon the world.",
  "[6210_LORE_3]": "Today, all that remains of Khet’s former glory are the jagged ruins of Khetar, dry and dusty, its inhabitants long gone. The only life you will find here are the eternal creatures such as the Anubite Warriors who wander aimlessly through the pillaged tombs, still looking for enemies that no longer exist.",
  "[6257_LORE_1]": "The Dragon Knights are one of the noble orders of Knights from Sword’s Edge. Sadly, their order was betrayed by the Knights Coronet, as their leader, General Luther, sought out Sheggra’s Heart to heal his ailing queen.",
  "[6257_LORE_2]": "Fortunately, General Luther was able to return to Sword’s Edge with the heart, then bring the Knights Coronet to justice, and begin the restoration of the Dragon Knights. Even now, their ranks swell with new recruits eager to wear the famed Dragon Helms as they serve the crown.",
  "[6257_LORE_3]": "It is believed they obtained their name from General Ioetta the Tenacious. She founded the order many centuries ago, before even the splintering of the Adanian Empire. Ancient tapestries and texts show her riding a huge golden dragon.",
  "[6289_LORE_1]": "A phenomenon that only seems to occur in Karakoth is the Void Portal. Sages have theorized it is because the fabric of reality - the veil separating our plane with others - is weaker there. Why is the fabric weak in Karakoth? Is it all the eldritch summoning that took place millenia ago? Or were eldritch Daemons simply drawn there because the veil was weak in the first place.",
  "[6289_LORE_2]": "When a void portal appears, it is quite a dramatic event. Rocks will thrust up from the ground like jagged teeth, and a swirling fiery portal will explode into place between them. Anyone who has witnessed this always comments that they feel a malevolent purpose at work. For this reason it is believed the portals may be actively created by Daemons from the other side.",
  "[6289_LORE_3]": "The biggest problem with Void Portals is the creatures that sneak through into our plane. Smaller Imps frequently appear, and while they don’t pose much of a problem, it is their larger cousins that do. For that reason, even the most corrupt and vile sorcerers in Karakoth will generally take the time to close down any portal they find.",
  "[6332_LORE_1]": "High in the mountains of Suncrest, the Stryx have built many fantastical monuments and temples. Some of those temples are dedicated to the Goddess of Dark Wisdom, Ixiquetacla, and it is here you will find the largest  gathering of the Owleth - every night they flock to these temples for a series of solemn ceremonies.",
  "[6332_LORE_2]": "To see groups of Owleth chanting is an eerie sight, but even more eerie is to watch them leave, their eyes glowing blue and staring sightlessly ahead. During these ceremonies, their Goddess gifts them with fragmentary visions of the future, but only the dark and ominous parts that may occur.",
  "[6332_LORE_3]": "As a consequence, the Owleth are prized for their Dark Omens. The Stryx royalty often keep Owleth around to warn them if there may be a dire consequence to an action they are taking. The problem is that there is very little one can do that doesn’t have a potential for a bad outcome. But the Stryx are a very conservative folk.",
  "[6360_LORE_1]": "Drakes are the flightless cousins of Dragons, and come in many types and sizes. They can be as large as the The Great Wyrm of Wyrmrun, or as small as the Simple Drake, known by most folk in Krystara as just the “Drake”. These smaller Drakes are very common, and can be found anywhere in the world.",
  "[6360_LORE_2]": "In Grosh-Nak, these Drakes are prized as mounts amongst the Orcs. They are extremely violent, ill-tempered, and difficult to train, so it takes a creature of matching temperament to have a good chance at bringing them under control. This makes Orcs the  perfect companion for them, and given a young Drake, with one or two years of training, they can eventually be ridden into battle.",
  "[6360_LORE_3]": "Once this bond has been established though, Drakes become incredibly loyal. If their rider is knocked down, it is not unusual to see the Drake standing over their body, protecting them. Most Orcs would leave them alone; as they know well, it’s not the bite of these smaller Drakes you need to watch out for, it’s the heavy tail slam that comes in from the side and shatters your spine!",
  "[6385_LORE_1]": "In the Leonis Empire, falconry is a popular sport practised only by the nobility. Every noble of any note will have at least one or two Falconers in their employ, and quite possibly a stable of different birds, including Falcons, Hawks, Eagles, Owls, and Osprey, all well fed and cared for.",
  "[6385_LORE_2]": "As such, a good Falconer is a highly-prized retainer. They work hard, but are extremely well-compensated for their skill and dedication to their birds. A Falconer’s day starts early, before their lords are even awake, training the younger birds. The day can also end late, as they ensure  all the birds are safe and well.  Many Falconers even sleep with the birds.",
  "[6385_LORE_3]": "Like most important professions, they have their own Guild, which oversees the qualifications and certification of new Falconers. Young men and women constantly apply to the Guild for training, but positions are usually purchased by middle-class parents with bribes paid to the Guildmasters.",
  "[6412_LORE_1]": "Like many of the Sky Elves of Shentang, Spellblades - the main protectors of the hidden kingdom - are tall, lithe, and elegant. As their name suggests, not only are they competent warriors, but they are also conversant in magic. And they can fly!",
  "[6412_LORE_2]": "In battle, the Spellblade will typically begin by imbuing their blade with a pulsing green light. As they swing it, not only does magic fire from the tip of the weapon, but the light grows, extending to enchant any allies standing nearby. A host of Spellblades side-by-side is a fearsome sight for any foe, as they all simultaneously light up and advance in unison.",
  "[6412_LORE_3]": "In recent years, the Spellblades have been at the forefront of the battle against Yao Guai and his Daemon army. But after his defeat, there has been a quieter time where the Spellblades have been able to meditate on their situation and - once again - begin the process of Ascension, where they aim to leave the mortal world behind.",
  "[6454_LORE_1]": "Deep in the Silver Forest, if you are paying very close attention, you might just catch a brief glimpse of a Hind. Not only are they incredibly fast and nimble, but their long flowing hair forms a remarkable camouflage in the undergrowth. Unfortunately, a glimpse of a Hind might also be the very last thing you see - they are powerful and formidable hunters.",
  "[6454_LORE_2]": "Hinds live in small family herds of 15 to 20 creatures, but frequently meet up with other herds at seasonal gatherings four times per year. These gatherings, known as Quarterfests, can attract hundreds, if not thousands, of the creatures. They run for almost a week, and the reveling can become quite wild.",
  "[6454_LORE_3]": "Between times though, Hinds are seldom seen, even by the sharp eyes of the High Elves. By day, the female hinds hunt, and the male hinds tend to their small hidden hobby farms. And by night, the herd will travel from one hunting ground to the next, before sleeping, and doing it all over again.",
  "[6464_LORE_1]": "There is a well-known children’s rhyme which serves as a warning about Bulettes: I found tracks, but much to my sorrow,, They were not ones I ever would follow, ‘Cause to fight a Bulette, It’s Urskayan Roulette, If it bites, there’s a chance it might swallow.",
  "[6464_LORE_2]": "Indeed, Bulettes are fearsome creatures. Fortunately, they are seldom found outside the Wild Plains, where they will typically burrow in amongst some rocks, then wait for a creature to pass by. They are fast, in short bursts, and can quickly take down something as large as a Minotaur, even swallowing it whole!",
  "[6464_LORE_3]": "Tauros will often band together, hunting a Bulette, as they are considered a delicacy. Typically they will try to find some creature to use as bait then go looking for Bulette tracks with their bait in tow. Once the Bulette pounces, the Minotaurs will leap atop it with their axes. It’s not unusual to see Minotaurs missing a limb or two from a Bulette hunting incident.",
  "[6538_LORE_1]": "The Spiritdancers of Maugrim Woods are powerful and talented oracles. They seek guidance from their ancestors by calling and conversing with Spirit Foxes, a rarely-sighted magical beast in the woods that exists half in this plane and half within the realm of spirits. The Spirit Foxes speak a strange language only the Spiritdancers seem to understand.",
  "[6538_LORE_2]": "The tradition of Spiritdancing originates in Vulpacea where the fox-folk converse freely with the spirit world on a regular basis. In Vulpacea, it is more a performance, and less of a magical ritual though. For the fox-folk of Maugrim Woods, who are less talented in the magical arts, Spiritdancing is the only practical way they have of talking with the spirits.",
  "[6538_LORE_3]": "The dances performed are long and intricate - a clear sign of their performative origins. At the end of such a dance, which can last well over half an hour, the Spiritdancer will fall prone from exhaustion and if the ritual was successful, a small Spirit Fox will appear, sitting upon their chest and whispering in their ear.",
  "[6561_LORE_1]": "Goblins get everywhere. You can’t travel anywhere in Krystara without finding some local variation on a Goblin. They share various traits in common though - they are universally fidgety, violent, unhinged, hungry, cunning, and always slightly peeved about something that’s actually too small for most sane folk to care about. Ice Goblins are all of those things… and blue.",
  "[6561_LORE_2]": "While Ice Goblins can be found all throughout the north of Krystara, you are most likely to find them in the abandoned mines of Dhrak-Zum. Here, their incredible tolerance for cold (and each other’s company) has allowed them to create a business blowing up the living ice crystals in the mines and selling their fragments to sketchy wizards.",
  "[6561_LORE_3]": "Like all Goblins, they are harmless if encountered by themselves. Also, like all Goblins, they are seldom ever encountered by themselves, as they prefer to move in murderous packs of 20 or more. If they catch you alone, you’re pretty much doomed, unless you look like you have absolutely nothing worth stealing.",
  "[6633_LORE_1]": "Most Raksha are fiercely loyal to their clans and families, but every rule has its exceptions. While many Raksha will undertake a quest to travel out into the Pridelands and slay the fiercest creature they can manage, some keep traveling - they are known as Free-Bloods.",
  "[6633_LORE_2]": "The term Free-Blood is often used as an insult amongst Raksha to question another’s loyalty. This is because the Free-Bloods seldom return. Often they work abroad as very effective mercenaries, using the power their cat-like ferocity has gifted them with.",
  "[6633_LORE_3]": "It is not unusual, when hiring a mercenary band, to find one or two Free-Bloods amongst its members. As might be expected, their attitudes differ widely; some regret their choice and wish they could return home, while others bask in all the world of Krystara has to offer.",
  "[6681_LORE_1]": "The landscapes of the Daemon Realms vary as much as the landscapes of Krystara. Not all of them are broken and burning hellpits wreathed in sulfurous fumes. Similarly, not all Daemons are fiery - some, like Ba’el, are covered in slime.",
  "[6681_LORE_2]": "Ba’el hails from the Daemon Realm of Brzgudlotrull - the Realm of Slime. Here all manner of foul Daemonic creatures crawl around in the fetid muck, feeding on each other. Some are formless, but many more are like great slimy reptiles and amphibians.",
  "[6681_LORE_3]": "Ba’el was summoned from this morass by a coven of Sea Hags on the Isle of Darkstone. Ba’el was fast - he had been both predator and prey in his home realm, but had been difficult to catch. Before the hags could bind him, he leapt away and bounded off into the night. He still roams the shores of Darkstone to this day.",
  "[6742_LORE_1]": "The Scarabi are the rarest of the scorpions found in the Drifting Sands, but their blue crystalline chitinous plates and their twin tails make them very easy to spot. It’s just as well they’re rare too, as the only thing worse than a giant scorpion, is a giant scorpion with TWO stingers!",
  "[6742_LORE_2]": "The Scarabi are prized trophies from a hunt, and every part of the creature is put to use. Although large, their meat is considered a delicacy. And their crystalline skin is used to craft the finest armor.",
  "[6742_LORE_3]": "Finally, the poison is extremely deadly, and the Sisterhood of Darkness on Darkstone are known to pay extremely well for any that is gathered. All that said, they are not endangered; their apparent rarity is mainly due to the fact that those who see them often never live to report the sighting.",
  "[6781_LORE_1]": "Deep within the dark borders of Ghulvania lives a depraved vampiric lord known as Vlad the Unsated. Originally just a villager in one of the small huddled Ghulvanian towns, Vlad rose to power after discovering an ancient cup belonging to worshippers of the Crimson Bat., It was known as the Chalice of Vampiric Thirst. Of course Vlad wasn’t aware of that at the time.",
  "[6781_LORE_2]": "Vlad knew the chalice was magical, however, and he toyed with it for many weeks before deciding to drink from it. The pain it inflicted upon him was extreme as his body began to change from human to something resembling a strange humanoid bat. And that was when the hunger began.",
  "[6781_LORE_3]": "Once the curse of Vampiric Thirst gripped Vlad, he couldn’t stop. Within a week, he had lured dozens of other townsfolk to his house, and drained them dry. He discovered with each one, his strength grew, and so over time, he seized control of his home village, then the villages nearby, and finally the castle of the lord who presided over them all. And still he was hungry...",
  "[6785_LORE_1]": "Sir Robert the Resolute was a terrible knight. The only thing lower than his standards was his intelligence. People often joked that his horse was smarter than him. Unfortunately they were right - so right that even the horse knew it. One day, as Sir Robert was riding home from another unsuccessful quest, trying to pick his nose through his visor with his longsword, his horse threw him and ran off.",
  "[6785_LORE_2]": "Sir Robert’s tale ends there, impaled through the cribriform plate with his own weapon. His horse however, moved on to greater things. Now free, and searching for a purpose, it discovered the Divinion Fields. A lush green land, filled with Centaurs who welcomed him.",
  "[6785_LORE_3]": "Grateful for his new life, Sir Robert’s horse resolved to protect its new home. Whenever a threat arose anywhere in the Divinion Fields, it would show up in full armor, ready for battle. Over time, the Centaurs referred to it as the Guardian of the Fields. ",
  "[6824_LORE_1]": "Crysturtles live alongside the Merfolk of Merlantis in peaceful harmony, and have long enjoyed a relationship built on mutual respect. The Merpeople defend the reef, keeping all who live there safe, and the Crysturtles act as living artworks, their shiny backs inspiring awe in those who pass them by.",
  "[6824_LORE_2]": "Not all Crysturtles are adorned with crystals of the same color - they come in all hues and combinations of the rainbow, and a Crysturtle’s crystal color may change over the course of its lifetime. There are benefits to all shades, as some may be more well-known for their beauty, while others are better at camouflaging with their environment.",
  "[6824_LORE_3]": "The love for Crysturtles is so strong in some Merfolk that they have formed groups that organize Crysturtle-watching expeditions. They like to let people know that they think these magnificent creatures are ‘Crys-turtally awesome’.",
  "[6945_LORE_1]": "Sir Alamir is the current leader of the Knights of the Burning Axe, and a descendant of the Undead Knight. the Watchman of Khetar, Sir Alastair. Like his ancestor, Sir Alamir is a masterful warrior, and a great leader who takes his responsibilities seriously.",
  "[6945_LORE_2]": "The Knights of the Burning Axe are one of the oldest orders of Knighthood in Whitehelm. Originally formed to repel a Frost Giant invasion long ago, they eventually found their place protecting the borders of Whitehelm from Khetari Undead.",
  "[6945_LORE_3]": "Each Knight, like Sir Alamir, carries a large two-handed axe. In battle they pray to Gard to ignite their axe, and if they have been true to their oath, the axe will flare up with a massive burst of searing holy fire that both Undead and creatures of frost have grown to fear.",
  "[6966_LORE_1]": "The hierarchies of the Fey are deep, twisted, and complex. This is true of the Wild Court, the Dark Court, the Winter Court, and especially the Summer Court. The Spring Emissary is a prime example of this complexity. Who does she represent? Where do her alliances lie? It is difficult to say.",
  "[6966_LORE_2]": "One thing is certain though, the Spring Emissary is a repository of knowledge. She knows everyone’s business in the Summer Court, and is often used as a first point of contact between two parties to settle a dispute or arrange a meeting.",
  "[6966_LORE_3]": "Being the Spring Emissary, she is also accustomed to liaising with the Winter Court, just as with the seasons, Spring is between Summer and Winter. But it has led many of the Fey to question - could there be a secret Spring Court that they do not know about?",
  "[7004_LORE_1]": "Soldiers of the Lord of Envy, these Daemonic maidens are so destined to become beacons of jealousy that they are literally born green. Obviously, that leaves them jealous of the beautiful fiery skin of other Daemons, which turns them greener still.",
  "[7004_LORE_2]": "The Maids of Envy were tasked with guarding a piece of the Ancient Maraji Crown, but sadly lost it to the Emperor Khorvash in his campaign to reclaim the Leonine throne. That saw them relegated to simple foot-soldiers of Envy, which - as you might guess - leaves them even greener.",
  "[7004_LORE_3]": "Today, the Maids of Envy are looking for a way back into their Lord’s good graces. As you might imagine, they are desperately jealous of all those above them in the hierarchy, and that makes them dangerous indeed.",
  "[7043_LORE_1]": "Grimmoira was once a Fey child abandoned and left to die by cruel parents in the Glacial Peaks. Fortunately, she was found by the sage, Tassarion, who took her in and raised her as one of his own.",
  "[7043_LORE_2]": "She became Tassarion’s student, where she excelled at learning, with an almost eidetic memory for the books she read. Soon Tassarion came to rely on her wide knowledge, and being the old curmudgeon that he is, would often consult Grimmoira, and then claim the facts or conclusions as his own.",
  "[7043_LORE_3]": "Still, Grimmoira is grateful to Tassarion for saving her life, and while she detests his rudeness and arrogance, she is loyal to a fault. In later years, she has become his personal librarian, managing his legendary collection of tomes and scrolls in his secret library in the Glacial Peaks.",
  "[7051_LORE_1]": "Wererats inhabit both urban and rural areas, feeding off the dregs and offcuts left behind by the more civilized races. They are scavengers by nature, but when the opportunity presents itself they have no qualms about resorting to thievery.",
  "[7051_LORE_2]": "When in giant rat form, Wererats can often be seen swarming the sewers and opting for safety in numbers. In their humanoid form, however, they will usually dart through the shadows alone, finding it easier to travel the world undetected.",
  "[7051_LORE_3]": "Though not naturally inclined to help those in need, a Wererat’s loyalty can be temporarily bought. Just don’t expect them to do more than explicitly asked of them, and definitely don’t expect a job done by a Wererat (or two) to be done elegantly.",
  "[7071_LORE_1]": "The first reported sighting of a Living Quartz being was believed to be a hoax made up by a Dwarven Miner trying to bring some excitement to his workplace. Opinions quickly changed when that same Living Quartz broke half the mining equipment.",
  "[7071_LORE_2]": "For a brief time, the Dwarves considered trying to mine ore from the backs of the Living Quartz, but eventually they came to their senses and realized they wouldn’t enjoy it if someone chipped away at little bits of their bodies. A few unscrupulous ones still try though.",
  "[7071_LORE_3]": "Living Quartz are actually quite patient beings, and are aware that a few miners may attempt to take ore from their backs. Dwarves have often said there is a ‘three strikes and you’re out’ rule - if you strike a Living Quartz three times, it will grab you and rip you apart!",
  "[7239_LORE_1]": "The Urska are, for the most part, a lovely people - family oriented, friendly to well-intentioned strangers, and simply desiring to get on with their lives in peace. Unfortunately, they live in one of the most inhospitable parts of Krystara, where some days, everything wants to kill you. It was from this fact that the Spirit of Rage was born.",
  "[7239_LORE_2]": "When the peaceful folk of Urskaya begin to grow angry, that anger manifests itself as a large red and black bear with angry red crystals protruding from its flesh. The Spirit of Rage seems to innately understand the target of the anger and sets out on a mission of blind hatred.",
  "[7239_LORE_3]": "As a defense mechanism, the Spirit of Rage has been very successful. If harming the Urska results in tenfold destruction visited back upon you, then you tend to leave them alone. Sadly though, this means most folk shy away from interacting withe the Urska at all, simple for fear of accidentally angering some of them.",
  "[7283_LORE_1]": "Having recently been led to believe she would bring about the end of the Spirit Talkers, Harper is understandably anxious about her place in the world. Despite being the supposed bringer of horrible fortune, she is well-liked among the fox-folk of Vulpacea.",
  "[7283_LORE_2]": "Harper has been playing the lyre since she was a young kit, and is adamant that it is a distinct skill from playing the harp, because for her to play the harp would be a little too obvious. Her mother, who still frequently boasts about Harper’s ‘harp playing skills’, is annoyed by this fact.",
  "[7283_LORE_3]": "Though Harper is now able to speak to spirits, she prefers to communicate with them through her lullabies. They allow her to convey complex emotions with the twang of her lute strings, and are often accompanied by simplistic lyrics.",
  "[7364_LORE_1]": "There’s very little loyalty amongst the pirates of Blackhawk - crew change ships often, as both pay, and vacancies (many caused by walking the plank) dictate. One crew member who has never been short of work is simply known as Boatswain Bart.",
  "[7364_LORE_2]": "Bart is a navigator extraordinaire. His abilities to navigate precisely through many of the reefs around Blackhawk and off the mainland coasts near the Pridelands has saved the life of his crew many times. Even at night he has the uncanny knack of sailing by the stars.",
  "[7364_LORE_3]": "Many folk have asked Bart if he wants to captain his own ship. ‘Maybe one day’ is his only response - he’s a man of few words. For now he seems content to learn every inch of coastline from Silverglade to the Leonis Empire and beyond.",
  "[7365_LORE_1]": "Goblins are stereotypically nasty, vicious,and sly little creatures. The merchant, Slughoarder, takes that to a new level by adding unhealthy doses of covetousness and treachery. They say that he would sell his mother for 10 gold. That’s not true - he already sold her for 3 gold when he was just a young gobling.",
  "[7365_LORE_2]": "Most folk who cross his path come away poorer for the experience - literally. Tales abound of his epic exploits in the underhanded vending of worthless junk; one tale tells of the time he sold a shipment of rocks to the Dwarves of Khaziel, which was actually just a piece of paper attached to a pickaxe, which read: 1.  Walk outside, 2. Start Digging Dumb%$",
  "[7365_LORE_3]": "Some people ask where his name came from. Did he ever actually hoard slugs? And if so, who did he sell them to? The answer is of course, yes. In one of his finest moments, he exploited his siblings by getting them (unpaid, mind you) to collect slugs for him for 2 years, at which point he sold the slugs AND siblings to the Troll Queen Sycorax as delicacies for a huge feast.",
  "[7366_LORE_1]": "Nobody is sure exactly where Jeweled Golems come from, but they are unique to Broken Spire. They are not Dwarven, nor are they Elven, Fey, or Daemonic in origin. Certainly, unsophisticated creatures like Infernus could not have created them. The mages of Karakoth have a theory they may be of Eldritch design though.",
  "[7366_LORE_2]": "Just as their origin is unclear, so is their purpose. It is clear they prefer to find something to guard, but failing that, they will wander the crags and caverns of Broken Spire aimlessly, murdering anyone they meet. Perhaps in an age long past, they guarded something of note that has been lost, and they are still looking for it.",
  "[7366_LORE_3]": "A few aspiring nobles and wizards have managed to capture a Jeweled Golem and set it to guarding their most prized treasures. It is remarkably effective, except that the Jeweled Golems will also try to stop the treasures’ owners from accessing their wealth. They are extremely dangerous, but also promote good saving and spending habits.",
  "[7369_LORE_1]": "Huntmaster Arborius is a renowned Dragonian hunter and tracker from Dragon’s Claw. His simple green scales prove useful for camouflage, particularly as he often hunts in the Mist of Scales, but once he has engaged his prey, his scales shine red as he fixes his sights upon them.",
  "[7369_LORE_2]": "Huntmaster Arborius’ bow is magical. It was acquired from a winged naga whom he battled in the swamp for a full week. Finally the naga was taken down, and offered up its bow in exchange for its life. This bow shoots magical arrows with wings on them that adjust their path to hit a target. To Arborius, they have always looked like Dragon wings.",
  "[7369_LORE_3]": "Huntmaster Arborius’ companion is a Cobalt Drake he rescued from some Orcish poachers many years ago. Together, they often guide travelers on paths through Dragon’s Claw, helping them to avoid contact with the Dragonians, who can be a decidedly prickly bunch. His fees are exorbitant, but his knowledge of hidden paths and ravines is legendary",
  "[7389_LORE_1]": "Prince Basalt is one of the royal family of Nexus. He is the son of Queen Ashe and King Heliodor, and the brother of Princess Shayle. Nevertheless, he is an accomplished warrior, and all believe that one day he will be a great leader.",
  "[7389_LORE_2]": "Like all those Born of Stone, Prince Basalt is in the ruling caste. The Stoneborn are the nobles of Nexus, whereas the Waterborn are the religious caste, the Fireborn are the warrior caste. And although the Natureborn are the worker caste, Prince Basalt has often argued that they are the most important ones - the glue who hold all of Nexus together.",
  "[7389_LORE_3]": "Given Prince Basalt’s ties to and love for the Natureborn, it is no surprise that he was a great supporter of the relationship between his sister, Princess Shayle, and the Natureborn Warden, Hawthorn. Unfortunately though, he did not give her a proper show of support when she needed it, but has vowed to make amends as he serves his Kingdom in the future.",
  "[7370_LORE_1]": "In the times before the Curse of Stone, the Panthers of Zhand, now known as Hellcrag, were revered by the people for their grace, power, and beauty. They were sentient creatures and often worked with the folk of Zhand to defend their kingdom.",
  "[7370_LORE_2]": "When the Curse was cast on Zhand by Medusa, it was not only the city that was affected. All manner of creatures in the surrounding lands were also caught up in the massive petrification that took place, and then slowly gained sentience over the centuries. This included the panthers.",
  "[7370_LORE_3]": "Today the panthers have adapted to their new forms. Once again, they are defenders of their kingdom, though it is now called Hellcrag, leaping through the craggy peaks surrounding the central city, and swiping rocks down upon any invading forces.",
  "[7390_LORE_1]": "The Iron Maiden is the infamous captain of the blighted ship - The Infernal Voyager. She has served in the naval forces of the Infernal King’s blighted army for many centuries, and led them to many victories over Darkstone, the Leonis Empire, and Grosh-Nak.",
  "[7390_LORE_2]": "In her early battles against Grosh-Nak, she captained an armada of burning vessels from the helm of the Fiery Seahawk, to smash into Grosh-Nak’s inadequate navy, destroying them all in the process, but bringing Grosh-Nak to its knees. Soon after, her King commissioned The Infernal Voyager as a reward for her leadership.",
  "[7390_LORE_3]": "While technically still a part of the Blighted Fleet, her work today takes her further afield as a privateer - raiding merchants for the Infernal King. Many a sailor has soiled his breeches when he’s spied the burning hull of The Infernal Voyager on the horizon, and realized The Iron Maiden was coming for him.",
  "[7372_LORE_1]": "Sea Hags are a constant threat for ships heading to Darkstone. Fortunately, few folk with good intentions ever travel there, so there is a certain sense of justice in the fact that Krystara is generally better off without them. The Sea Hags, for all intents and purposes, do seem to perform a vital function in reducing the number of scumbags traveling the seas.",
  "[7372_LORE_2]": "Typically, the first sign of a Sea Hag attack involves a ship being becalmed around 50 miles off Darkstone’s coast - the ocean becomes flat and the wind stops blowing. The Sea Hags then use their Tidal Curse to drift the ship towards their coven where they can rise up and pull the sailors from the decks, drowning them.",
  "[7372_LORE_3]": "The Lords of Darkstone, tired of having their illicit trade disrupted, have tried to exterminate the Sea Hags more than once, but they have strong ties with other covens of hags on Darkstone. When the Darkstone War Galleys arrive, the Sea Hags are inevitably nowhere to be found. But when they head back to port, one or two will mysteriously vanish…",
  "[7391_LORE_1]": "King Triton of Merlantis is a wise and noble leader of his people, much beloved by all the Merfolk. But like all wise and noble leaders, he has accumulated many enemies over the years. The Triton Guard are a hand-picked group of warriors who attend to the King all day, every day; one does not rule for centuries without a little healthy paranoia…",
  "[7391_LORE_2]": "Mera joined the Triton Guard at a very young age. Like many young Merfolk of common birth, she aspired to become one of the guards, as it would bring both her and her family much honor. From the moment she could pick up a trident, she would practice her forms for hours out in the open waters, and all the practice finally paid off.",
  "[7391_LORE_3]": "By chance, Terranaeus, the Captain of the Triton Guard, saw her practicing alone one day. He quickly organized to bring her before the Guard Council, and they unanimously voted for her to join. Within just four years, she was awarded the honor of wielding a golden Ocean Trident, marking her as one of their elite warriors at just 20 years of age.",
  "[7392_LORE_1]": "Sir Ailuin leads the Crystal Knights of Silverglade, an elite unit who guard the caves of the Crystal Dragons. When one thinks of Dragons in Silverglade, one usually thinks of Krystenax, but there are so many more than that. From the tiny Silver Drakons, up to their much larger and shinier cousins, they live with Krystenax in caves close to the palace.",
  "[7392_LORE_2]": "Sir Ailuin is descended from a long line of Crystal Knights, and has guarded Krystenax’s extended family for over a century. He takes a special interest in protecting their eggs. Dragon eggs can take decades to hatch, and are extremely vulnerable to predators and thieves. Many times Sir Ailuin has saved them, and over the years has built up a strong bond with the Dragons.",
  "[7392_LORE_3]": "He has, with his dedication, won back honor for his family. Sir Ailuin’s grandfather once failed in his task, and 7 eggs were stolen. Krystenax’s offspring were taken by an evil Sorcerer from Karakoth who turned his children into the fercious beasts Amethelias, Diamantina, Emeraldrin, Garnetaerlin,  Rubirath, Sapphirax, and Topasarth, who broke free to terrorize the world. Today they have been driven underground, and can be found deep within dungeons throughout Krystara.",
  "[7380_LORE_1]": "Long before it became known as Hellcrag, the city of Zhand was home to many different creatures, not least amongst those were the Fey, who lived in a grove outside the eastern gates, surrounded by Treants. They were generally on good terms with the sisters who ruled the city.",
  "[7380_LORE_2]": "As the city fell to the Daemons, and Medusa enacted the Curse of Stone, the Fey were quick to escape; they already lived outside of the walls, and were able to get beyond the radius of the curse. The Treants were slow though, and they barely had time to move beyond their circle as their trunks and leaves were petrified.",
  "[7380_LORE_3]": "As the centuries passed, the Treants gradually regained some movement - even more now that the curse has been lifted. Some of them have passed back over the seas to the Bright Forest, but many more have remained to help rebuild Hellcrag, and perhaps, in time, restore the city of Zhand.",
  "[7423_LORE_1]": "Undead Armies have a natural advantage - their troops serve a multitude of purposes. It’s very nice when your infantry can be recycled not only as building materials for your siege weapons, but also as ammunition for those very same weapons.",
  "[7423_LORE_2]": "The first Bone Catapult was created by the Gray King himself as he lay siege to the outer keeps of Sword’s Edge. As he marched westward, he would throw his army against a keep’s walls to overwhelm the defenders, then raise the dead from that castle as a new army, while turning his losses into bone catapults for the next siege.",
  "[7423_LORE_3]": "This tactic almost allowed him to conquer the entirety of Sword’s Edge. Had it not been for a spirited defense from the Griffon Knights, he may well have triumphed. Nevertheless, the Bone Catapult has been a staple in the armies of Ghulvania ever since.",
  "[7424_LORE_1]": "Eyestalkers are a very rare sighting in the Mist of Scales. They are distantly related to Mist Stalkers, but larger and even more aggressive. Rumors say that they are the result of a magical experiment by a Lamia to turn Mist Stalkers into an elite force that could guard her queen.",
  "[7424_LORE_2]": "If that is the case, the Lamia certainly got the part of the spell right allowing Eyestalkers to be hyper-aware of their surroundings. Their eyes are large, extremely effective, and able to twist and turn at all angles. It is almost impossible to sneak up on one.",
  "[7424_LORE_3]": "Some Naga mystics believe the eyes of an Eyestalker hold very powerful magical properties. They claim the vitreous fluid inside can be distilled to create a potion that allows a creature to see great detail at even greater distances. The fact that it is so highly prized has probably contributed to the scarcity of these misshapen creatures.",
  "[7426_LORE_1]": "Another of the great lizards who roam the Drifting Sands, the Hornwing is a rare one that can fly. Even though they can fly, Hornwings probably spend more time gliding, circling ever upwards on the thermals that spiral over their desert home. They will typically float there, looking for any sign of life below which might be a potential meal.",
  "[7426_LORE_2]": "Once they spot their prey, the Hornwing will go into a dive, traversing a large sweeping arc, then flaring their wings at the last moment and striking with their claws. Their aim is to cause enough chaos and confusion that they can land and then skewer their prey with the huge horn on their head.",
  "[7426_LORE_3]": "If the prey is large, Hornwings - being solitary hunters - will typically eat it where it falls. But anything man-sized or smaller will be foisted upon their horn and carried back to an eyrie for other Hornwings to share.",
  "[7428_LORE_1]": "Most Centaurs are born with a connection to the stars, but Hippolyta was always different.She was born on an overcast night, deep in the forest where no stars could be seen. As she grew up, she was always drawn more to the forest than to the great gathering that celebrated the Astral Spirits. ",
  "[7428_LORE_2]": "When she was barely into her teens, she began to travel further and further from her home. Ostensibly she was learning to hunt, but in reality she was simply enjoying her time alone in the forests, learning the paths, the plants, and the secret ways that Centaurs rarely studied.",
  "[7428_LORE_3]": "When it was time for her coming of age ceremony, many years later, she was nowhere to be found. Far from home, she’d forgotten all about it. In some cultures, this might lead to exile, but Centaurs are a practical and accepting folk - they embraced Hippolyta’s love of solitude, and she began her adult life doing what she still does today - watching the borders of the Divinion Fields, guiding lost travelers, and learning more about secret ways of the forests.",
  "[7429_LORE_1]": "There are two distinct types of Daemons that can be found in Krystara. The older ones hail from the Eldritch Realm - a place of great power and chaos. While the younger ones come from the Infernal Realm - a barbaric and brutal place, and source of the Blight. Tempurath is one of the oldest Daemons from the Eldritch Realm.",
  "[7429_LORE_2]": "Although Tempurath is very old, his levels of power do not approach the great Eldritch Lords like Zuul’Goth. His task was, is, and always will be, to track the passing of time in the Eldritch Realm and all realms adjacent to it. Where possible, he appears to observe important events, and report them to Eldritch Lords.",
  "[7429_LORE_3]": "Many Eldritch Daemons have an unusual mutation. Tempurath’s is unique - instead of coming into the world with eyes, he has clocks in their place. The scholars of Karakoth believe they are not actual clocks; it is merely that we perceive them as such. A primitive creature might see them as an hourglass, or even as vision of the sun passing rapidly overhead.",
  "[7431_LORE_1]": "Not all Fey are civilized and live with Queen Mab in the Winter Court. Some, like the Bestial Fey roam the peaks or the tundra, reveling in the howling flurries and deadly storms. Such creatures are rare, but extremely dangerous.",
  "[7431_LORE_2]": "The Bestial Fey, or Chillstone as he was once known, was once a regular Fey. The Fair Folk do not generally have strong family bindings, but in his 200th year Chillstone saw his entire family crushed by giant stone Dwarven siege machines. A rage over took him - one from which he never recovered.",
  "[7431_LORE_3]": "In the centuries that passed, Chillstone was often seen rampaging through the foothills near Khaziel, howling and tearing at the very mountain and rocks. Gradually, his name passed into darkness, and those who saw him ripping rocks apart just referred to him as The Bestial Fey.",
  "[7432_LORE_1]": "Deep within the mines of Dhrak-Zum, the Dwarves dug too deep. They unearthed a portal to the Abyssal Realms - not the regular realms of fire, but one of the terrifying realms of ice. The Living Rime were one of the creatures who came through.",
  "[7432_LORE_2]": "The largest Daemon to enter through the portal was Glaycion, a hulking brute who brought many of his kin with him. Chief amongst these was his lieutenant Arcturion, but many smaller Daemonic spirits came too - the Dwarves named these the Living Rime.",
  "[7432_LORE_3]": "The Living Rime are only vaguely sentient. The servants of greater Ice Daemons like Glaycion, they simply await direction from their masters. With Glaycion gone, they now wander the mines of Dhrak-Zum aimlessly, blasting anything they see with bolts of ice.",
  "[7434_LORE_1]": "The creation of Golems was - for a time - a secret known only to eldritch sorcerers who scoured the old lands of Geheron (now Karakoth) for secrets. Although these secrets had originally come from ancient Maraji craftsmen, they were lost after the fall of the Maraji Empire, only to be found a millennium later in a dead god’s tomb.",
  "[7434_LORE_2]": "The secrets of Golem creation though, did not remain secrets for long. The sorcerers traded them for knowledge, and soon many different races and kingdoms knew how to create Golems. One of the first races to trade for them were the Dark Elves of Zhul’Kari. They were not naturals at this kind of craft though, and their first attempts resembled nothing more than splintered trees.",
  "[7434_LORE_3]": "These Splintered Golems, as they came to be known, may not have looked as ferocious and sturdy as the creations of other races, but they were fast, lethal, and completely obedient. Today, many of them are still employed by noble Dark Elven houses, but many more have lost their masters and wandered into the wilds.",
  "[7436_LORE_1]": "The Egris is the royal bird of Suncrest. Many of them reside in the palace of King Garuda, where they are decorated with ornate chains and jewels and provided shelter and food. They are never caged though, and are free to leave if they so choose.",
  "[7436_LORE_2]": "Many do leave for a time but often return in the winter months. They are accomplished hunters, with keen sight, and have no difficulty surviving in the wilds. It is illegal to keep an Egris, or to hunt them, which unfortunately leads to foreign poachers seeking them out for their fine soft feathers. If they are caught though, the penalty is a slow and painful death.",
  "[7436_LORE_3]": "A handful of the palace Egris have formed a relationship with the royal family and their servants. They seem able to communicate on some level, and are often requested to fly out and guide travelers either through the hidden paths of the mountains or simply to the palace. It is unknown how the Egris understand these requests, but many believe them to be extremely intelligent creatures in their own right.",
  "[7461_LORE_1]": "One unusually out-of-place denizen of Silverglade is the Arcane Sabercat. If you thought it looked more like something you might find in the Pridelands, then you would be correct - the Pridelands were where these creatures originated. They were brought back to Silverglade by High Elven explorers as gifts for the royal family",
  "[7461_LORE_2]": "The original creatures brought to Silverglade were not ARCANE Sabercats though - they were just regular Sabercats. Trying to domesticate and imprison any type of feline is generally futile - even moreso with a cunning creature like a Sabercat. Before long, many of them had escaped into the forests where they began absorbing the magic of the Elven woods.",
  "[7461_LORE_3]": "Within two or three generations, Sabercat kittens were being born infused with arcane magic - it seems they had a natural ability to adapt to a new environment. Already ferocious hunters, this new breed of Arcane Sabercat wreaked havoc upon the wildlife of Silverglade. It has taken many generations for these creatures and the High Elves to reach an uneasy truce, where the Sabercats respect the wildlife, and the Ellves respect the Sabercats’ lands.",
  "[7460_LORE_1]": "One of the lesser-known races of Giants inhabiting Stormheim are the Earth Giants. Smaller than many other Giants, but wiry and strong, the Earth Giants are considered valuable allies by any of the Kings and Queens of Giantkind, as - like Jordrin - they often have some unique talents.",
  "[7460_LORE_2]": "It’s no surprise that, in the same way as Fire Giants might summon flames, or Frost Giants might control ice, that Earth Giants have a measure of control over the very earth itself. Jordrin’s basic talent is not entirely unusual - it involves talking to boulders in the ground and coaxing them out.",
  "[7460_LORE_3]": "But Jordrin has another talent - he is particularly charismatic for an Earth Giant. And he puts this to use by convincing the boulders of the joy of flight. Thus he finds they can assist him as he lifts them up and hurls them through the air, shattering the walls and towers of anyone he dislikes. Do the boulders like this? You’d need to ask an Earth Giant, but we suspect that anything is preferable to being stuck in the ground for a century or two.",
  "[7416_LORE_1]": "When the Mydnight Queen took control of the Kingdom of Mydnight, she warped all the creatures therein to conform to her ideals of perfection. She even altered the King’s Hounds, changing them from huge muscular beasts to emotionless skeletal shadows of their former selves.",
  "[7416_LORE_2]": "One thing they never lost was their hunger. Eternally hungry, but no longer able to satisfy that craving, they became wilder and more ravenous as the years wore on. On occasion, their raspy howling would become so annoying that the Queen would simply let them loose among the people of her kingdom.",
  "[7416_LORE_3]": "Most would return from these hunts, their loyalty as frozen in time as the Kingdom of Mydnight. But some would not - hiding on the edges of the Kingdom where time was fluid and ever-changing, catching any travelers as they passed by Mydnight’s latest location.",
  "[7469_LORE_1]": "Kit wasn’t always known as Kit the Sly. When he was a youngling, he was very quiet and kept mostly to himself. It was this nature that helped shape his future though. The time spent by himself, exploring places and going softly through the forests of Vulpacea gave him a certain set of skills. He would not be called Kit the Shy for very long.",
  "[7469_LORE_2]": "When Kit was still a tween, he happened across a cave where he found all sorts of treasures. Unfortunately for him, it belonged to a Giant. Nevertheless, Kit managed to get most of the gold before the Giant noticed him leaving and gave chase. When it finally caught him back at the village, he bribed it with the gold he’d stolen, and overnight became known as Kit the Sly!",
  "[7469_LORE_3]": "Since then, he’s managed to defeat a Dragon single-handedly with a tooth he pulled from its mouth, take down a Giant Gorbil by getting it to swallow its own hind leg, and stave off a Behemoth by getting it to choke on a large rock instead of him. He’s extremely dangerous, and very good at turning the tables on larger foes.",
  "[7471_LORE_1]": "The Forest of Thorns is as much a home to Beasts as it is to the Wood Elves; when it is threatened, the two share in its defense. But when it comes to exploring, many of the Beasts - particularly the winged ones - have a natural advantage. One of the greatest explorers is Lady Adelwing of the Great Eagles.",
  "[7471_LORE_2]": "Great Eagles can live for up to 300 years. Now in her third century, Adelwing can still soar at incredible speeds, and amazing heights. She is able to cross the full breadth of the massive forest in as little as 2 days. Her greatest advantage though is her keen eyesight. ",
  "[7471_LORE_3]": "When the Great Eagles were threatened by the Winged Blight over a century ago, it was Adelwing who led her people to a secret eyrie in the Thorn Peaks.  There, she regrouped and then approached the Elves to coordinate an attack on the Daemonic invaders. Ever since, the Elves and Great Eagles have had a close relationship.",
  "[7472_LORE_1]": "Orcs have a saying: The bigger the Orc, the greater the swagger, but the smaller the Orc, the sharper the dagger. While that may be the pinnacle of Orcish poetry, it is also quite true. Smaller Orcs often end up as Rogues; they are fast, angry, and prone to all sorts of filthy tricks.",
  "[7472_LORE_2]": "Orcs know this, so only a foolish Orc Warlord would banish their smaller kin - it’s a surefire way to wake up dead with a dagger in your eye. Instead they employ these Orc Rogues for all manner of underhanded tasks, including intimidation, scouting, thievery, and occasionally a bit of light and friendly assassination.",
  "[7472_LORE_3]": "Sometimes Orc Rogues can rise to positions of power in society, usually if they can get control of a network of Orcs similar to themselves. One of the most famous Orcish Rogues was Toth’Shrak the Blade, who managed to assassinate his clan leader and carve out a small empire in eastern Grosh-Nak for four decades until his untimely death from a Dragon. The lesson was this: You can’t intimidate Dragons.",
  "[7474_LORE_1]": "The Pandaska of Shentang are not generally known as academics. They mostly like to lay around eating bamboo, or to get drunk on their jasmine-scented bamboo wine and start fights.They prefer to leave the intellectual pursuits to the Sky Elves. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, and Sheji Shi is one such exception.",
  "[7474_LORE_2]": "From the time they were a cub, Sheji Shi was curious about everything. They often got into trouble from the Sky Elves, for pulling apart some of their wondrous inventions to see how the magic worked. Unable to perform magic though, and desperate to build something as marvelous as the Sky Elves, Sheji Shi turned to gears and pulleys, studying them and using them in intricate ways.",
  "[7474_LORE_3]": "Since then, Sheji Shi has made many amazing inventions, none of which use magic. The first was the Pandallista, a huge bolt-throwing war machine that can also be used as playground equipment for young Pandaskas. After that came the Pandistillery, a wondrous contraption that distills, bottles, and labels bamboo wine, and also serves as an automatic feeder for goats. Currently, Sheji Shi is working on something called the Pandaeroplane - a flying machine. Stay tuned…",
  "[7475_LORE_1]": "When the seal between Krystara and the Underworld was breached many years ago, the remaining Lords of Sin began a search for how to protect it. They wanted their solution to work both ways, to keep the Daemons in, and to keep the mortal races out! In the time it had been open, there had been movement both ways, creating a problem for both worlds. They found a champion, known as the Dark Herald.",
  "[7475_LORE_2]": "The Dark Herald was originally a captain in Tarterus’ armies, commanding a legion of mighty war machines in the Depths of Sin. Having led dozens of missions, and never failed a task, he was an obvious choice for the first portal guardian. Leaving his command, he traveled through the portal to the Sin of Maraj in  Krystara, where he now waits, ready to stop any creature traveling in either direction.",
  "[7475_LORE_3]": "His goal was not simply to keep the portal closed, as Kerberos had done with its own gate, but instead to question travelers and determine if their cause was legitimate. The Lords of Sin agreed that keeping the portal entirely closed for so long was indeed a mistake. Because there are some heroes and monsters you cannot keep in (or out).",
  "[7477_LORE_1]": "Over the course of many years, since the betrayal of the Knights Coronet, General Luther - and later Amira,his unlikely protege - have been rebuilding the Order of the Dragon Knights from Sword’s Edge. One of the key factors has been Amira’s recruitment and training of the Dragon Commanders and their Brass Drake companions.",
  "[7477_LORE_2]": "The Dragon Commanders mix Sword’s Edge tradition with some Lysean cunning. They are heavily armored knights, all experienced warriors, and commanding a company of 100 troops. They lead from the center, as is the Lysean tradition, and because they are often involved in the actual fighting, they keep a Brass Drake by their side.",
  "[7477_LORE_3]": "The real test of becoming a Dragon Commander is to travel south and find a Brass Drake to tame - not an easy task. Young Brass Drakes though, once bonded, become a loyal companion for life. Orcs have been riding larger Drakes into battle for many years - the Drakes will even stand over the dead body of their fallen rider, protecting them.",
  "[7479_LORE_1]": "The Wargare Druids and Rangers spend many years learning the paths and secret ways through the tangle of Maugrim Woods. Every 5 years, a council of most senior Druids and Rangers will set aside their tribal differences to meet and elect their most esteemed member - the Keeper of the Paths. After their inauguration, they are joined by a wood spirit, known as a Timberwolf, who will accompany them for the next 5 years.",
  "[7479_LORE_2]": "It is the task of a Keeper of the Paths to maintain records and maps of all the ways through Maugrim Woods. These are not kept in books, because the nature of life in Maugrim Woods means the weather and constant travel would cause too much damage. Instead they are engraved in a secret code onto wooden totems. The Keeper travels between tribes, constantly updating this information.",
  "[7479_LORE_3]": "The engraving process is managed by the Keeper of Paths, but is actually performed by the Timberwolf, the wood spirit who now accompanies the Keeper everywhere. Timberwolves are able to intricately manipulate wood into complex shapes and patterns. After a Keeper’s 5 years are up, they are never elected again, but their Timberwolf companion will follow for the rest of their days.",
  "[7480_LORE_1]": "Rune Chanters serve a vital role in Dwarven Culture. Dwarven Runes are magical inscriptions which Dwarves use for all manner of things, including protection, health, prosperity, and good fortune. These Runes are written by Rune Carvers, and then activated by Rune Chanters.",
  "[7480_LORE_2]": "Most Dwarven dwellings will have a number of Runes inscribed in them. There will be protection on the doors, health in their kitchens, and even fertility in their bedrooms. Once every year, a Rune Chanter will be employed to visit the dwelling and activate the Runes to ensure the prosperity of the family within.",
  "[7480_LORE_3]": "Even the throne halls and mines of the Dwarves are covered in Runes, often thousands of them. They can be very complex, and deal with many situations; they almost read like a contract or a set of laws to be enforced. Dwarven Rune Chanters will always be found here, activating the runes to keep the community prosperous, safe, and orderly.",
  "[7482_LORE_1]": "The Tawarite Priestesses served a lesser-known cult in Ancient Khet, the worship of the Tawaret, the Hippopotamus-Goddess of the Fertility, Rivers, Floods, and the bountiful harvests that followed. Tawaret was a popular deity in households throughout the ancient kingdom, as she represented the fierce protection of hearth and home.",
  "[7482_LORE_2]": "Like the Anubite and Settite Warriors, these priestesses were summoned to serve at the temple. Unlike those warriors though, their functions were only ceremonial and protective, but any attacks on a Tawarite Temple were met with fierce resistance. For that reason, wearing an Amulet with the image of a Tawaret became popular throughout many households, to ward off thieves and brigands.",
  "[7482_LORE_3]": "Unfortunately, when the rivers of Ancient Khet dried up after the battles of the Settites and the Anubites, Taweret’s power waned; her Priestesses were left to wander the encroaching desert. Many of them still wander there today, fiercely angry that their beloved rivers were destroyed.",
  "[7483_LORE_1]": "The Maze Guardians are constructs of living stone, servants of King Stormgard, who protect his Labyrinth. Deep within the Underworld, inside that Labyrinth, they will stand immobile for decades, until a thief or intruder passes by. They will then spring to life, swinging their axes until the trespasser is carved neatly into hundreds of pieces.",
  "[7483_LORE_2]": "The Maze Guardians were originally created by King Stormgard. In the distant past of Krystara, when the line between mortals and Gods was blurred, this great Minotaur rose to power. Eager to cheat his inevitable death, he fled to the Underworld, and built a labyrinth so vast and complex that not even Death could find his way through.",
  "[7483_LORE_3]": "Along with deadly traps, the Maze Guardians were King Stormgard’s final line of defense; they might not be able to stop Death himself, but they would stop his servants from finding a path to the Labyrinth’s center. The only map, used in the Labyrinth’s creation, had been broken into many parts and hidden by King Stormgard long ago.",
  "[7485_LORE_1]": "The Anointed are a group of elite gladiators from Darkstone, created when a Thrall consents to subject themselves to a horrific ritual. When the ritual goes wrong, it produces creatures known as Remnants, who are used to entertain the Lords of Darkstone. When it goes right, it produces the Anointed. Sometimes though, it goes one step better…",
  "[7485_LORE_2]": "For every ten Thralls, whose life is so miserable they risk everything to become an Anointed, only one succeeds. For every one hundred who succeed though, only one will become an Anointed Champion - a warrior without fear - as brutal as a Behemoth. They are highly prized by the Lords of Darkstone, and often taken from the Arenas to be used in battle.",
  "[7485_LORE_3]": "The Corrupt Sorceresses of Darkstone, in their jeweled towers, have tried for many years to perfect the process of Anointing, to create more Anointed, and more Anointed Champions, but have had no success. Many believe it is the Thrall themselves that determines their fate, not the Anointing ritual. Should they ever succeed though, the armies of Darkstone would become truly terrifying.",
  "[7495_LORE_1]": "From the outside, looking in, Karakoth quite often seems to be a disjointed collection of warlocks and sorcerers, who revel in murdering each other almost as much as they revel in finding hidden secrets beneath the eldritch ruins that dot the shattered landscape. There are some, however, such as The Cartographer, whose purpose unites everyone (well, almost everyone… Draxxius is REALLY disagreeable).",
  "[7495_LORE_2]": "The Cartographer travels the land of Karakoth, collecting information about ancient lore and artifacts that have been found, and detailing their locations. He seems to have no interest in acquiring the artifacts himself, just in plotting them on his maps. He has even shared patterns with many of the Sorcerers to help them make new discoveries.",
  "[7495_LORE_3]": "Many believe The Cartographer must have some secret purpose. Perhaps there is something HE is looking for, and he is searching for signs? There’s certainly something strange about the way he never ages, and the manner in which he will appear after any historic find. Regardless, he is an invaluable source of information about Karakoth, who is quite willing to share his knowledge.",
  "[7496_LORE_1]": "When most folk think of the Urska, they imagine huge ferocious warriors, angrily ripping their enemies apart. And they would be right for the most part. But some Urska also follow the magical arts - usually associated with nature and Druidic rituals. There is one whole clan of Urska who are exceptions to this rule; they are the Bearlocks.",
  "[7496_LORE_2]": "The Bearlock Clan are into some quite dark stuff. Dabbling in Necromancy? That’s what bones are for! A bit of Chaos Magic? It wouldn’t be any wilder than their celebrations! Deals with Daemons? Just show them where to sign their name in blood! The Bearlocks are weird, dangerous, and savagely unhinged.",
  "[7496_LORE_3]": "With all that in mind, it is still possible for outsiders to deal with the Bearlocks. There is a flat 10% chance they will be sacrificed, eaten, and experimented on (in that order), but If they are approached with something that sounds illegal, immoral, or downright dangerous - or better yet, all three - there is a good chance they may be interested.",
  "[7498_LORE_1]": "At the stairs to the Great Library of Hellcrag, stands an immense statue of an armored knight, known as Goethite. Still regaining his mobility after the lifting of Hellcrag’s Curse, Goethite has returned to his original purpose - protecting the immense archive of knowledge behind him, but with renewed vigor and greater powers.",
  "[7498_LORE_2]": "Originally a Golem, set to guard the Great Library, Goethite was made entirely of iron. Hellcrag’s curse did not only affect creatures of flesh though - Goethite’s iron skin also turned to a dark lustrous stone as he was frozen in place. He has retained that stone now, and seems to have also found a measure of control over the stone around him.",
  "[7498_LORE_3]": "If the Great Library is threatened, Goethite can call the stone in the steps to rise up into a huge buttressed wall, sealing off access entirely as he lays about himself with his great iron-stone sword. Many have wondered what this creature might do if he turned his purpose towards defending the city itself, or even attacking an enemy stronghold.",
  "[7499_LORE_1]": "As Dragons get older, they usually continue to grow. As they get bigger and more powerful, their treasure hoards become more vast and valuable. That’s most Dragons though. Occasionally you run into a Dragon that just becomes miserable and crotchety. Venerabilax is one such Dragon.",
  "[7499_LORE_2]": "Venerabilax lives in a cave by himself. He gets few visitors, and those that do venture into his lair are usually met with very loud “Damn Whelps! Get off my hoard!”, which is enough to keep everyone away. For the most part, Venerabilax seems content to potter around in his caves, reading old scrolls, tending to his mushrooms, and sleeping.",
  "[7499_LORE_3]": "When Venerabilax does venture out, it is usually to make complaints or to give other Dragons or Dragonians some unwanted advice. All of Dragon’s Claw remembers the time he showed up to complain that the weather had simply been too pleasant, and to demand that the Draconic Council do something about it, or the time he tried to explain to Volthrenax how to “do lightning” properly.",
  "[7501_LORE_1]": "The Leonis Empire has long had a relationship with the Raksha of the Pridelands. The Emperor’s Elite Guard is known as the Prideguard, and consists of the brightest and the best Raksha that can be found - it is an amazing honor to join the Prideguard.  Many Raksha who are not able to become Prideguard still join the Empire though, and they become Lion Commanders.",
  "[7501_LORE_2]": "Lion Commanders are trained as leaders for a cohort of the Empire’s troops. They will lead their cohort of 480 troops while sitting atop their mounts - giant lions also from the Pridelands, known as Mane Coursers. They train with these mounts for years, and the two become inseparable. When a Lion Commander’s mount is killed or dies, they will retire from military life, and carry their loyal mount’s ashes back home.",
  "[7501_LORE_3]": "Sadly, the opposite is not true. If the Lion Commander is killed in battle, their Mane Courser will fly into a terrible rage. First it will murder those who killed its master, but after that, it will lay about slaughtering friends and foes alike. All troops know to give wide berth to an enraged Mane Courser.",
  "[7503_LORE_1]": "The Cyclops are not their own race, they are actually the offspring of two regular giants who just happen to be born with one eye. Depending upon the parents, and the culture, a cyclops may be celebrated, hidden away, or even thrown out of Giant Society. Fortunately for Jarnvisa, his birth was a good omen.",
  "[7503_LORE_2]": "On the day he was born to a noble family for Frost Giants, the Ice Witch of Stormheim attended. It was almost as if she knew what was about to happen. When she saw Jarnvisa, she proclaimed ‘None see so clearly as those with a single eye, I claim this one for my own’, and she left.",
  "[7503_LORE_3]": "Jarnvisa’s village was blessed with good fortune from that day forward, until the Ice Witch returned 10 years later. “I have returned to apprentice the child,” she told his parents. Such a proclamation from the Ice Witch was rare, and the whole village celebrated as Jarnvisa was taken away to his new life - a life filled with magic.",
  "[7504_LORE_1]": "If there is one phrase that sums up the inhabitants of the Bright Forest, it  is this - beautiful but deadly. Lord Belladonnus of the Summer Court is a perfect example. To all external appearances, he seems a foppish lordly type - fair of face, slender of build, and light of foot. To underestimate him would be foolish though.",
  "[7504_LORE_2]": "Belladonnus has a special relationship with plants - especially flowers. Plants worship and adore him, and they willingly spring to his defense at the slightest threat. Your first thought might be: What can plants do to me? The answer is: Quite a lot of painful and surprising things.",
  "[7504_LORE_3]": "Their leaves and petals can obscure him, distract, and hide his attacks. Their pollens can cause allergies and uncontrolled reactions. Their sap can be poisonous. And their thorns can draw blood. If Belladonnus seems at ease and unconcerned with danger, it is because he has surrounded himself with the  best protection in the realms - the adoration of nature.",
  "[7506_LORE_1]": "As a young child, Doe was unremarkable, like a lot of other young wildfolk in Pan’s Vale, she was fond of various contests, such as running, jumping, and swimming. It wasn’t until her village was attacked by Goblins, that her clan realized she had a special talent.",
  "[7506_LORE_2]": "The day the Goblins attacked Doe’s village, she let out a terrifying scream. It stopped the Goblins dead in their tracks. Rumors say that quite a few eardrums were broken that day, and one Rock Troll actually had its head explode! Of course, Doe was the village hero after that, but it wasn’t long before a group of elders - worshippers of Orpheus - sought her out for further training. ",
  "[7506_LORE_3]": "After many years, and much training, the Shamans of Orpheus discovered that Doe could literally break rock with her voice, and thus she became known as Doe Stoneshatter. Her wild calls were useful for a lot more than just protecting against Rock Trolls though, they could be used for quarrying, masonry, and even offense if any Dwarves tried to build towers too close to the Vale.",
  "[7507_LORE_1]": "When Dhrak-Zum was conquered by the Daemon, Glaycion, many Dwarves were slain. Those in the deep mines suffered the most. Although many of them were miners, some of them were guards, sent to keep the miners safe. Their spirits should have been left in peace, but sadly, the Bonebinders would not let sleeping spirits lie.",
  "[7507_LORE_2]": "Of those they raise from the dead, the Bonebinders do not put all to use. Many of them are simply left wandering the tunnels. In death, they are bereft of purpose. They are looking for something to protect, but nothing lives down here. Or they are looking for something to fight, and unless a Daemon or adventurer wanders past, that door is closed to them too.",
  "[7507_LORE_3]": "And so these Lost Warriors continue to wander the deep mines, lighting their way with ghostly lanterns, looking for something that is not there. Their battle is long past, and they have lost, and their tragedy stretches into eternity before them. Until the day a Hero comes to end them, and the work of the Bonebinders,  their torment will continue.",
  "[7509_LORE_1]": "The fiery Angel, Retribution, was sent as a messenger of Gaard, to serve the Kings of Whitehelm. Retribution loyally served them for many centuries, helping to destroy the foes of Whitehelm, whenever and wherever they appeared. But eventually, Retribution grew bored - even an Angel of Fire is meant for so much more than war.",
  "[7509_LORE_2]": "The King at the time, Aldrenon, gave Retribution a quest - to find the Bounty of Freedom, a magical scroll that would not only make Whitehelm stronger, but also act as a beacon of hope to those in less fortunate lands. Retribution set out on the quest. His wings carried him through tempests and across chasms, until he reached a dark forest. He pressed forward, fueled by duty and a longing for justice.",
  "[7509_LORE_3]": "Retribution faced trials in the dark forest that tested his virtue: a river of silver snakes, a labyrinth of thorns, and a mirror that reflected his inner demons. Yet, he pressed on, driven by the belief that freedom was worth any sacrifice. Finally, he reached the center of the woods, but there was no scroll. And Retribution realized his mistake. Freedom was not a solitary quest - it could only exist if it was woven by angels and mortals together.",
  "[7511_LORE_1]": "A Slitherling, also known as a ‘Snake of Many Snakes’, is the result of an Ophidiomantic spell gone terribly wrong. Ophidiomancy is a particular branch of the magical arts involving the summons, transformation, and alteration of snakes. It is rarely seen outside of the Naga, and still quite rare even amongst them, usually only being practiced in their royal courts.",
  "[7511_LORE_2]": "Sometimes if an Ophidiomancer attempts a spell far beyond their capabilities, there are two magical backlashes, representing the two heads of the magical serpent, Amphisbaena. The first backlash transforms the caster into dozens of snakes, and the second gathers those snakes up into a single semi-sentient entity.",
  "[7511_LORE_3]": "Once created, the Slitherling has no memories of its previous life. It is now driven by the collective hunger of all the snakes that form its body. It will stumble along, devouring anything in its path, until that hunger is sated, where it will collapse into a morass of writing serpents for up to a week, before reforming.",
  "[7527_LORE_1]": "In the forgotten catacombs beneath Zaejin, there once lived a Goblin known as Hob. Hob hated the lands above - he hated how the sun burned him, and how the light hurt his eyes. So he burrowed down into the darkness where he led a peaceful and solitary existence.",
  "[7527_LORE_2]": "But things in Zaejin never stay still for long. Hob learned about a book named the Tome of Shadows. It held secret incantations to hide the sun, and darken the skies. He began to search for it, traveling by night, hiding by day. Years stretched into decades and eventually Hob passed away in a dark corner of Zaejin, all alone.",
  "[7527_LORE_3]": "As is often the way with such things, his passion in life echoed into the afterlife, and his spirit rose up to continue the quest. Over time, Goblins saw him roaming, and they named him Gloomhob, for his spectral visage. It is said that to this very day - if you travel Zaejin under the new moon, beware, lest Gloomhob comes by, looking for his lost book.",
  "[7529_LORE_1]": "In the Pridelands there once lived two Raksha named Shadowhisker and Whisperclaw. Not only were they lovers, but also famed assassins, members of the Crescent Moon Tribe, and masters at the arts of stealth and silent murder. But those who live by the blade also die by it, and so was the way with Shadowhisker.",
  "[7529_LORE_2]": "While traveling abroad in Sword’s Edge, on a mission to kill a petty lord who had been oppressing his people, Shadowhisker made a grave mistake. She underestimated the skill and tenacity of a simple guardsman, and found herself on the end of a pike. Neither the petty lord nor Shadowhisker lived to see the sunrise, but Whisperclaw refused to accept his lover was gone.",
  "[7529_LORE_3]": "He carried the body across Krystara for weeks, barely resting, until he arrived with Shadowhisker’s decomposing remains in the ruined Kingdom of Khetar. He sought out the Keeper of Souls, and begged for his lover’s return, and the Keeper struck a deal. They would be together again - both as spirits - for 100 years. Then their souls would belong to him and him alone.",
  "[7530_LORE_1]": "Many centuries ago, the Ghulvanian Counts attacked Sword’s Edge in what became known as the War of Blood. Many defenders were slain, until a hero known as Lady Morana defied a corrupted King to lead the Order of the Azure Blades, and drive the Ghulvanian Counts back. This Fallen Knight is one of those loyal defenders.",
  "[7530_LORE_2]": "Sadly, the King was jealous and had Morana slain. They were never given the heroes’ burials they deserved, but were instead banished into the Underworld, to be forgotten except in myths and fairytales. But history unacknowledged has a way of making itself known again.",
  "[7530_LORE_3]": "During an Undead incursion throughout the Realms of Krystara, the Fallen Knights have found gaps from the Underworld, and risen from their tombs, to start wandering their homeland of Sword’s Edge. They are not intentionally hostile to the folk who live there, but centuries interred in the Underworld has driven many of them mad…",
  "[7532_LORE_1]": "On the southwestern edge of Silverglade, the Forest of Mists is ruled by the Mistveil family. Their eldest daughter, Liora, was a magical savant. At age 11, she had already mastered the art of Veilwalking - parting the mists so that she could travel great distances in the blink of an eye.",
  "[7532_LORE_2]": "When she reached her teens, she befriended a Blue Mistlark, named Aerith - a rare Avian creature born from the mists themselves. Aerith’s feathers shimmer like twilight, and it perches on Liora’s shoulder, its eyes keen and watchful, alerting her to hidden dangers. It’s song could bend the mists to Liora’s will.",
  "[7532_LORE_3]": "As she grew past her teens, Liora learned to defend the forest. In the Battle of the Silver Eclipse, she stood against the Shadowweaver - a malevolent sorceress who sought to shroud Silverglade in eternal darkness. With the help of Aerith’s song, Liora shattered the Shadowweaver’s illusions, revealing her true form - a twisted Daemon. The Glade was saved, but Liora’s heart still bears scars from that fateful night.",
  "[7534_LORE_1]": "Ignarion is a well-known and well-respected mage-scholar amongst the Nexians. As well as being a powerful wizard, he is also extremely knowledgeable in historical matters, especially ancient rites and battles. His love of lore began when he sat his trials for the Ebon Tower - the College of Nexian Fire Mages.",
  "[7534_LORE_2]": "The trials of the Ebon Tower take place in catacombs beneath the tower itself. Students are sent to traverse the tunnels, searching for the Ebon Flame. Once they have found it, they bring a piece of it back to the council, so that it may sustain the tower’s energy source. Ignarion did not just find the Ebon Flame though, he walked into it.",
  "[7534_LORE_3]": "Once he was inside the Ebon Flame, Ignarion found something interesting - a magical book he refers to as the Tome of Ebon Flame. He took the book with him and began a long study of it. It contained the history of many worlds connected to Nexus, stories of great battles, of wise and cruel kings - stories of the magic they used, and the weapons they wielded - enough for a lifetime of study.",
  "[7535_LORE_1]": "The Broken Spire is home to many odd creatures. Most of them are born of the fires in Mount Gorathor - the jagged volcano from which the island kingdom takes its name - from the mighty Infernus and Amorok, to the lowly Pyggra. Alongside these creatures though, are numerous tribes of violent and constantly-warring Ogres, now including some that are no longer alive - the Ghost Ogres.",
  "[7535_LORE_2]": "The problem with Ogres is that their three favorite sports are making large weapons, maiming each other with them, and killing anything that moves (including other Ogres). This makes for a lot of dead Ogres. And that was never a problem until the rise of King Aldric, and the wars of the Frostbound Sword, when the dead returned to walk Krystara.",
  "[7535_LORE_3]": "So, today, as well as its infestation of regular Ogres, the Broken Spire also has a lot of Ghost Ogres. In many ways it’s an improvement. They don’t make as much noise stomping around. They tend to be settling old grudges with each other, rather than finding new ways to cause mayhem. And frankly, they just leave a faintly ozonic smell, which is the largest improvement of all.",
  "[7537_LORE_1]": "Crypt Worms are monstrous creatures that can grow up to 10’ in length. They burrow through earth and stone with ease, as they secrete a powerful acid that can erode all but the toughest stone. They often create extensive networks beneath graveyards and ancient tombs.",
  "[7537_LORE_2]": "Crypt Worms are scavengers by nature, primarily feeding on the corpses they unearth in tombs and burial sites. They are drawn to the scent of decay and can detect the presence of a corpse from miles away. Their digestive system is highly efficient, allowing them to extract nutrients from even the most desiccated remains.",
  "[7537_LORE_3]": "Crypt Worms are often associated with curses and dark magic. They exude a necrotic aura, and are innately drawn to any necromantic magic. It is said that they were created by a long-forgotten necromancer who sought to guard his tomb with them, but instead they devoured him and went looking for more.",
  "[6898_LORE_1]": "There are many types of bats in Krystara, particularly in the kingdom of Ghulvania, but one breed stands out in many ways - the Doombat. Not only is its midnight and crimson color quite striking, but its wingspan stretches over 3 meters. What is most memorable about the Doombat though are the myths and legends associated with it.",
  "[6898_LORE_2]": "Known for their endurance, Doombats range far and wide from their deep caves in Ghulvania. They are considered by most folk to be a sign of ill omen. Many villagers will ward their doors and windows with protective charms made of silver and moonstone to keep them away. If they do appear though, their distinctive cry announces them, it is thought by many to herald a death in the family.",
  "[6898_LORE_3]": "Much of the fear of Doombats possibly stems from the Great Krystaran Plague, many centuries ago - the first recorded sighting of a Doombat coincided with the beginning of the plague. After that, they were hunted, nearly to extinction. Had it not been for their ability to shadowmeld and hide, they may indeed have been wiped out. Some folk even believe the horrors they now visit are revenge for that culling.",
  "[7538_LORE_1]": "Wargs were once Dire Wolves from Maugrim Woods. Unfortunately,the dark necromantic energies of Kerberos’ portal corrupted them, morphing their appearance and voices into something horrific. It was no surprise that many Wargs were hunted down, killed, and burned - especially since their howl could end a person’s life. But it was a surprise when many of these creatures began rising from their ashes.",
  "[7538_LORE_2]": "Fortunately, their appearance favored their original form, but the good fortune ended there. They now seem to be under a curse - to wander Maugrim Woods, eternally howling, with each cry heralding the death of a mortal. Fortunately, sunlight banishes them for a time, so the Wargare of the Woods are free to go about their business during the day.",
  "[7538_LORE_3]": "Each night brings a fresh terror though, with the Wargare, and any travelers in the woods, holed up inside, covering their ears to shut out the sound, as the Warg Spirits gradually assemble into a spectral pack. The only way to find them is to spot their phantom tracks, which appear and disappear in the blink of an eye.",
  "[7540_LORE_1]": "The Snowy Owls of Glacial Peaks are an intelligent species, with a unique society of their own devising. Whether it has always been that way, or whether some Fey magic has leaked into their bloodline, not even Tassarion - the sublime scholar of all things Fey - is certain. The leader of the Snowy Owls is known as Moonfeather.",
  "[7540_LORE_2]": "Still dazzling to behold, Moonfeather has lived over four centuries, giving credence to the idea that Fey magic is indeed behind this. She has led her people through many troubled times - through wars with Urska, Giants, and even Daemons. She is fearless and always leads from the front, as her magic is potent.",
  "[7540_LORE_3]": "Legends and tales about Moonfeather abound. They say she once stopped the 3 hearts of the Daemon Witch Khaa’ren, with a single shard of ice. They say her spells are so powerful, that she even froze the heart of an Ice Giant, Lord Jotrenor of Stormheim, who had threatened to wipe her species from the realms and make pillows out of them! Clearly, she demands respect as much as any Fey Lord from Glacial peaks.",
  "[7542_LORE_1]": "The tale of the Drowned Wanderers began a long time ago. When King Aldric the Frostbound began his military campaign, he built a tower upon an island, off the coast of Sword’s Edge. His plan was that, on an island with only his most trusted guards, he would be safe from assassins. Sadly, he never counted on the folk of Merlantis. They saw the island as a threat, and sank it beneath the waves. ",
  "[7542_LORE_2]": "King Aldric survived and went on to wage war across Krystara, but many of his personal guard, and the masons who built the doomed tower were not so lucky. Dragged down beneath the waves by the Merfolk, their lifeless husks haunted the tower and the waters above it. Long after King Aldric’s legend was forgotten, they would occasionally attack a ship as it sailed above them.",
  "[7542_LORE_3]": "Sailors learned to give these waters a wide berth, and not knowing their origins, referred to the watery undead as Drowned Wanderers - thinking of them merely as other sailors lost at sea, looking for a way home. The folk of Merlantis did not forget however, but they seldom spoke of their battles against King Aldric… Until his spirit returned.",
  "[7419_LORE_1]": "Mydnight is home to many strange characters and creatures, each with unique and disturbing stories to tell. The Lady of Ruin’s is one of the strangest though. She tried to escape the city many centuries ago by making a pact with a Fey Lord who identified himself only as the Wyrm of Shadows. Pacts made with the Fey can be very dangerous though…",
  "[7419_LORE_2]": "Originally known by the name Alvira, one night, having fallen into despair at being trapped within Mydnight, she summoned a Fey from the Dark Court and told it she wished to escape. It had a simple proposal: Bring me the soul of a child, and I will set you free of this place. Desperate, she did as requested, and the Fey cast her out of the city, but into the void between worlds.",
  "[7419_LORE_3]": "There she remained, tormented for a decade, until the creature visited her once more. “One more soul”, it asked her, and I will consider your freedom. Predictably then, over the centuries, this murderous pact played out time and again. Alvira came to be known as the Lady of Ruin, since her arrival in Mydnight would herald the death of a child. And somewhere, in the Dark Court, a Fey known as the Shadow Wyrm grew more powerful.",
  "[6121_LORE_1]": "In the dimensions beyond Krystara live many strange and powerful elder beings, whose names, thoughts, and motivations are incomprehensible to the ordinary folk of Krystara. Cthyryzyx is one of the lesser of these beings, but is still powerful and dangerous by mortal standards.",
  "[6121_LORE_2]": "Born from the primordial ooze of the elder dimension, Cthyryzyx was summoned to Krystara by a Warlock in the mountains of Karakoth, looking to strike a bargain with an elder creature. Unfortunately, the Warlock’s circle of protection was incomplete, and one of Cthyryzyx’s tentacles snaked through, skewering the hapless Warlock through the eye.",
  "[6121_LORE_3]": "Since then, Cthyryzyx has wandered the wastelands of Karakoth, looking for a portal back to his dimension. As he has no means to communicate with the Warlocks, his questions are misinterpreted as hostility, leading to attempts at binding spells, which in turn lead to more Warlocks losing an eye and one hemisphere of the brain behind it.",
  "[7130_LORE_1]": "While the Gladewardens form the first line of defense in the Forest of Thorns, it is the Thorn Scouts who exist out beyond that line, gathering intelligence on any threats to the forest. Wood Elves may move silently through the trees, but the Thorn Scouts are an elite group, who make less noise than a shadow in the moonlight.",
  "[7130_LORE_2]": "Thorn Scouts will often be deployed within their homelands to assess a new threat before heavier troops are sent in. If caught off guard, they are also more than capable warriors, wielding twin daggers made of iron oak, and entwined with the thorns of the obsidian rose plant.",
  "[7130_LORE_3]": "Beyond the borders of the Forest of Thorns, they can also be found in Whitehelm, Karakoth, Khetar, the Mist of Scales, and Grosh-Nak, where they often undertake secret missions for the Wood Elf Lords, in attempts to preemptively upset any nefarious plans by the rulers of those rival realms. Wood Elves may seem a fair and generous folk, but the Thorn Scouts are neither of those things when their kingdom is threatened.",
  "[7553_LORE_1]": "Although Khetar is home to many grand pyramids - monuments to the rulers of ancient Khet, it is also home to many thousands of smaller monuments to the lesser nobles who ruled its many regions. Much as the pyramids house ancient mummies, these lesser monuments - also known as barrows - house their own terrors, the Barrow Lords.",
  "[7553_LORE_2]": "Usually, during their lifetime, the Barrow Lords were greedy, ambitious creatures - jealously protective of their high status, and always looking to accumulate more influence and wealth. In death, they retain many of these qualities, eternally seeking to satisfy an unrequited ambition for more power.",
  "[7553_LORE_3]": "Merely being in the presence of their barrows at night may get their attention, and they will emerge from their barrows with a host of shield and khopesh-bearing warriors. No subtlety is involved, they will attempt to dominate all whom they find on their ancient lands, take their wealth, and add the deceased trespassers to their warrior-host.",
  "[7555_LORE_1]": "The first Blight to strike Krystara took a terrible toll in the southern lands, corrupting many creatures, from men (who became the Blighted Heralds) to the Dragons themselves who were changed into Fell Dragons. It also affected the beasts of those lands too, with many dogs, wolves, and foxes corrupted into Blight Hounds.",
  "[7555_LORE_2]": "Blight Hounds retain many of the characteristics of their original form. They like to hunt in packs - sometimes numbering up to fifty - and have an established hierarchy of leadership. Unlike most regular beasts though, they hunt for pleasure as well as food; the anguish and pain of their foes nourishes the corruption in their souls. ",
  "[7555_LORE_3]": "Many Daemons in the Blighted Lands will attempt to gather and train packs of Blight Hounds, with only the strongest able to do so and not be torn limb from limb. They will then employ them to hunt, track, or go into battle where they can indulge their corrupted natures and spread the Blight even further.",
  "[7556_LORE_1]": "The Lords of Darkstone are a corrupt and vile bunch. They deal in drugs, human trafficking, and bribes - their tendrils reach out as far as Whitestone and the Leonis Empire. Lord Desollatus is one such lord, typical of his kind, neither more powerful nor more evil than his kin, though he does have one specialty - ancient secrets and rituals.",
  "[7556_LORE_2]": "As a younger man, he was a merchant, trading in information and secrets with the Dark Elves of Zhul’Kari, and the Naga of the Mist of Scales. There he learned many magical secrets. Though he was not a practitioner of magic himself, he found that such knowledge could be sold to sorcerers for a hefty price.",
  "[7556_LORE_3]": "One day, he uncovered the lore of someone known as Archdruid Blackwood. Astounded by the power of this ancient Druid, he spent many years learning how to summon him from the past, as he would prove a worthy pawn in the long game against Adana. Ultimately he passed this information to the Lords of Darkstone in exchange for his own lordship.",
  "[7557_LORE_1]": "Every pirate in the Isles of Blackhawk has their own specialty. They might be the toughest, the meanest, the richest, the most handsome (or beautiful)... They might even be the most ridiculous like Lil’ Johnny Bronze. But if you want the fastest, you’d need look no further than the Red Corsair.",
  "[7557_LORE_2]": "The Red Corsair’s ship - the Scarlet Zephyr - is a medium sized galleon, built for speed. Narrow of beam, it has less drag than its wider counterparts. And its great length and larger sails give a startling hull speed that allows it to almost plane over the water. Of course, the skill of the Red Corsair herself should not be underestimated - they say she was born of the wind, and can feel its subtle changes.",
  "[7557_LORE_3]": "The ship once made the run of Darkstone to Sword’s Edge in under a week - running contraband - a phenomenal task considering she outran 3 wyverns who chased her all the way. The crew of the Red Corsair are some of the finest trained sailors out of Blackhawk, all fiercely loyal to their captain, who treats them as equals and rewards them well.",
  "[7558_LORE_1]": "Al-Mundhir, known as the Genie of the Golden Sands, is easy to spot, if for no other reason than the intricate golden tattoos on his body. Like all of the 1001 Genies of Maraj, his origins date back to the earliest days of the Maraji Empire, long before the rule of Emperor Scorpius.",
  "[7558_LORE_2]": "In the ancient days of Emperor Bat’Ara the Merciless, mages were rounded up and imprisoned. Bat’Ara himself had no skill with magic, so expressed his contempt by imprisoning mages in containers designed to restrict their movement, butallow his courtiers and advisers access to the magical power.",
  "[7558_LORE_3]": "Al-Mundhir was one such mage - a master of the sands - who could summon a storm to confound his enemies. Unfortunately, his skills were no match for the Imperial Guard of Emperor Bat’Ara, who tracked him through a swirling storm, to capture him and imprison him for millenia.",
  "[7560_LORE_1]": "Bears are active in summer, and owls are active at night, so as you might imagine, Summer nights are a dangerous time in the Forests of Zhul’Kari, as the Dusk Owlbears are at their most active, hunting, hooting, and helping themselves to a snack on anything that moves and is smaller than them.",
  "[7560_LORE_2]": "A strange relative of the regular Owlbear, they have three notable differences. Firstly their feathers are dark to provide camouflage. Secondly, their bright red eyes are NOT good at seeing in the dark - instead they have evolved to frighten their prey, because prey on the run makes noise!",
  "[7560_LORE_3]": "Which speaks to the Dusk Owlbears’ final difference - they use echolocation to hunt their prey, like a bat. Even among the Elves of Zhul’Kari, the Dark Screech of the Dusk Owlbear is a terrifying sound, because it is a clear omen that something or someone is about to die.",
  "[7562_LORE_1]": "In the wild southwestern portion of the Divinion Fields live an equally wild tribe of Centaurs known as the Zebrataurs. All types of Centaurs have a nature that matches their animalistic part, and much like actual zebras, the Zebrataurs are angry, objectionable contrarians who like trouble.",
  "[7562_LORE_2]": "When they’re not  fighting, shooting, or generally causing trouble, the Zebrataurs move in mid-sized herds. They are nomadic, and will move to new locations as the seasons change. This migratory behavior makes them the most widely-traveled tribes in the Divinion Fields.",
  "[7562_LORE_3]": "Given their travels, the Zebrataurs are often hired as guides, however they can be somewhat unreliable. They often quarrel with their employers, or - worse - become hostile halfway through a journey. The very best outcome you can have with a Zebrataurs guide is to have only been distracted by one or two battles along the way.",
  "[7563_LORE_1]": "There is exactly an 83% chance that any mech created in Adana by Sparkgrinder will make everything worse. So, it is rather amusing that his latest creation is named FIXIT-5000, when all indicators suggest that it should have been called FUBAR-5000 instead.",
  "[7563_LORE_2]": "In fact, the universe’s immutable Laws of Irony, show that FIXIT-5000’s chance of failure should be tripled, giving exactly a 94.3 (recurring) % chance of failure. Not good. And given Sparkgrinder’s track record, it may potentially be civilization-ending in its capacity for spectacular failure.",
  "[7563_LORE_3]": "Fortunately, for Sparkgrinder, Adana, and the rest of Krystara, his apprentice Ghiralee helped in this project. Anything Ghiralee touches generally turns out okay. So FIXIT-5000’s ability to repair damaged parts, or to replicate completely broken ones may actually have a chance of success.",
  "[7585_LORE_1]": "For Dwarves, mining is more than just a job, it’s a calling and a way of life. If most Dwarves were just sitting around, minding their own business with nothing to do, it’s likely they would just grab some picks and shovels, and start digging a hole. But, if you have too many holes things get dangerous, so the role of the Overseer is a very important one!",
  "[7585_LORE_2]": "As you can see, Dwarven Miners need to be organized and coordinated, lest their incessant digging causes structural issues in their mines. Overseers are one part manager, one part structural engineer, and one part thug - you’re simply not going to be able to give orders to a mine-crazed Dwarf unless they’re scared of you.",
  "[7585_LORE_3]": "All that said, there is no official qualification to be an Overseer, the positions are largely passed from parent to child. At a very young age, the apprentice overseers will be taken to the mines to observe and learn from their parents as they manage, plan, and threaten the Dwarven Kingdoms to greater heights.",
  "[7587_LORE_1]": "Or’Drak, was a regular Orc, with a run-of-the-pit job. He was an average, gray-skinned, Grosh-Naki slob. He liked drinking, and fighting, and stories of war. He had an average hut, with a nice straw-filled floor. His swords, his armor, his boots, and his dagger made him happy, as he walked, with his bow-legged swagger. ",
  "[7587_LORE_2]": "But sometimes that just isn’t enough to keep an average Orc interested. Or’Drak wanted power, and he wanted it as easily and cheaply as possible. The problem was, Or’Drak had no idea how to get that power - an average Orc usually ended up as a casualty on a battlefield somewhere. So when a Daemonic spirit offered to make a pact with Or’Drak, he was all in.",
  "[7587_LORE_3]": "Filled with Daemonic power and rage, Or’Drak changed his name to Dae’Drak. Quickly rising through the ranks - a wake of bodies in his bloody path - Dae’Drak soon found himself leading a powerful warband, but still in thrall to the Daemonic Spirit who had made him the offer.",
  "[7589_LORE_1]": "The foxfolk - known more generally  as the Vulpine - are very closely related to the Wargare. However, they are not as warlike as their Lupine cousins from Maugrim Woods. They mostly live in harmony with nature, communing with the spirits. There is always an exception that proves the rule, and that exception is Ragepaw.",
  "[7589_LORE_2]": "Vulpine have an insult; if they consider someone rude, violent, or obnoxious, they will say ‘they have a bit of dog in them’. This has been said often of Ragepaw. Many foxfolk think there may indeed be a bit of Lupine in his bloodline - he is bigger, stronger, and angrier than most of his kin.",
  "[7589_LORE_3]": "All that rage has its uses though. Brash and grating he might be, Ragepaw is loyal to his friends and home - he has proved to be excellent at keeping larger threats away from his homeland with his unique mix of brutality and cunning. Some among the Vulpine are concerned that he has aspirations to the Crown of Vulpacea though.",
  "[7591_LORE_1]": "The Peregrines of Whitehelm are an elite unit of scouts used by the most highly-ranked Paladins in the kingdom. Far more intelligent than a regular bird, Peregrines can understand detailed commands from their keepers, and can even communicate back with their cries and their body language.",
  "[7591_LORE_2]": "With their sharp eyesight and ability to soar high in the air and hover, Peregrines perform a number of functions for the Whitehelm forces. Firstly they can scout enemy numbers, strength, and position. In any battle against Whitehelm, their foes should expect to see a number of these versatile raptors hovering over the battle at all times.",
  "[7591_LORE_3]": "Secondly, Peregrines make excellent scouts. With their amazing ability to communicate, they can find the most appropriate paths through the wilderness in any situation. Finally, although seldom called upon to act in this way, they are fierce warriors, able to assess and strike at any enemy’s weakpoint.",
  "[7592_LORE_1]": "Deep within the murky swamps of the Mist of Scales there lived a Naga named Melek Tauss. Born small and weak, he was preyed upon by his larger brethren, bullied and beaten into submission every day. But that which could have destroyed merely set him on a path to revenge. ",
  "[7592_LORE_2]": "Too small to join the Scaleguard, and too pathetic to be apprenticed to a shaman of the court, Melek Tauss turned to the one thing that welcomed everyone - the rituals of Daemonic Summoning. He traveled into Karakoth where he committed unspeakable crimes just to have access to the Red Library, until finally he was ready.",
  "[7592_LORE_3]": "Melek Tauss traveled back into the Mist of Scales, to his home village, where he summoned a Portal and unleashed a small plague of Daemons upon the Naga there. Now, wanted by the Royal Court of the Mists, he still travels the dark places of his homeland, summoning portals, and unleashing vengeance upon guilty and innocent alike.",
  "[7594_LORE_1]": "The pigeon-folk of Suncrest are one of the most disliked sub-species of Stryx, even by their own people. Most of them are scrappy and uneducated - contributing little to Stryx society except for the scavenging of garbage. The other Stryx often refer to them as ‘rats-with-wings’.",
  "[7594_LORE_2]": "Every so often though, amongst the pigeon-folk, one hatches with a rare-mutation - a tiny pointed crest that sets them apart from their kin. Such Stryx are believed to be destined for great things. They are given the title ‘Crested’ and are taken into society and given opportunities - the most recent is named Crested Ava.",
  "[7594_LORE_3]": "From the time she was a chick, Ava displayed an unusual command of storms - she would fly up into them, and seemingly control them from within. After she saved the great Sun Temple of Xenutichtlan from an unusually powerful tornado, she was given her title - Crested Ava the Feathered Tempest.",
  "[7595_LORE_1]": "A common creature found throughout the castles of the Lords of Ghulvania is the Doomed Guardian.  These haunted suits of armor are typically deployed as sentries and watchmen, and due to their unusual origin, they understand basic commands and may be given rudimentary orders.",
  "[7595_LORE_2]": "Where do they come from? Well… The trusted human servants of the Ghulvanian Lords are given certain… privileges. They are allowed to sip the blood of their vampiric masters, which extends their life to three times that of a normal human, but alas, not forever. However, they never TRULY die.",
  "[7595_LORE_3]": "Their spirits are bound into armor by their Lords, and they are then given one final privilege - to guard their Undead masters until they are defeated in battle, or until their master - a Lord of Ghulvania - is slain. Eternal servitude is not everyone’s idea of a good time, and it is said that if you remove a Doomed Guardians helmet, you will be haunted by the anguish on its spectral face until the end of your days.",
  "[7597_LORE_1]": "Whenever an Angel descends to aid the Free Folk of Krystara, the universal balance demands that a new Daemon is born. So when Valor came down to rebuild Sword’s Edge, after the treachery of the Knights Coronet, the idea of a new Daemon took root in the Sin of Maraj - the Bane of Valor.",
  "[7597_LORE_2]": "Where Valor is a noble warrior, dedicated to the mastery of battle, the Bane of Valor is the diametric opposite. He skulks, he hides, he runs away, but above all he will use any foul means at his disposal to land a blow upon his enemies. Over the years since Valor appeared, his nemesis has bided his time in the Sin of Maraj, waiting to emerge.",
  "[7597_LORE_3]": "Now is the Bane of Valor’s time. With Sword’s Edge rebuilt, and amidst a flood of other Daemons entering Krystara through the Unholy Portals, he has emerged from his homeland to visit chaos upon the world. He may never confront Valor directly - that is the nature of cowardice - but he will stand in the dark places, ready to sew fear and discord among the Free Folk.",
  "[7598_LORE_1]": "There was once a Minotaur named Longhorn the Reaver. He was an accomplished warrior (hence his title) but there was something he loved even more than battle, and it was puzzles - in particular mazes.",
  "[7598_LORE_2]": "One day, while out exploring, he encountered a strange creature; at first he thought it was a Fey, because it offered him a bargain. It would show him a fantastic maze, and if he could find his way through it, the creature would grant him a wish. The creature however was not Fey, it was a Daemon in disguise, and it planned on tricking him.",
  "[7598_LORE_3]": "The Daemon cast a spell, mesmerizing Longhorn, trapping him in a mind-maze from which there was no escape. When he realized his error, Longhorn screamed silently, begging to be set free, but it was too late - the Daemon was already in control. When he returned to his tribe, Longhorn was different - his skin had turned red, and he came to be known as Redreaver, one of the fiercest Minotaurs in the Wild Plains.",
  "[7599_LORE_1]": "Yao Guai, the Daemon Lord of Shentang had many servants, the most powerful of which were the animals who guarded him. His hounds - the Hounds of Yao Guai - guarded the entrance to his keep. But the Lions of Guai were given a more honored position guarding his treasures.",
  "[7599_LORE_2]": "With Yao Guai defeated, and the Sky Elves searching peacefully for a means of ascension, the Lions of Yao Guai have searched for a purpose. When various Daemonic portals began to open in their homeland, the Abyssal scent in the air was familiar to them, so they began guarding the portals.",
  "[7599_LORE_3]": "Possessed of enough intelligence to hope for their master’s return, the Lions of Yao Guai guard any such portal they find. They will allow Daemons through, but will most definitely not allow any creatures within Krystara to approach and risk their last chance to be reunited with their master, Yao Guai.",
  "[7406_LORE_1]": "Many years ago, the three Goblin scoundrels, Murk, Lurk, and Durk, were doing some… business… in Sword’s Edge when they came upon an object so unthinkable, so creative, so wondrous, that they knew they must immediately have it. At the stroke of midnight, they snuck into Falstaff’s Fantastical Fashion Emporium, and liberated this most unusual magical artifact… a trenchcoat.",
  "[7406_LORE_2]": "Their thinking was simple. Goblins had always been looked down upon - it made it hard to complete a shady deal when most tallfolk realized that your eyes were about the same height as their moneypouch. But if they all climbed into The Trenchcoat of Power, then they would be the equal of any human, and in fact, even MORE trustworthy than a Dwarf!",
  "[7406_LORE_3]": "When Murk, Lurk, and Durk returned to Zaejin they were rich. It wasn’t that people started believing their scams exactly, but The Trenchcoat of Power DID allow them to get close enough to targets so that Durk (on the bottom) could sneak a hand out between the buttons and help himself to those moneypouches.",
  "[7600_LORE_1]": "Most Centaurs spend their time looking upwards - at the sun, the moon, the stars, and the clouds. They have found answers to many questions in those heavenly bodies. Discordia, however, was always a contrarian. Instead of looking up, she was always looking down.",
  "[7600_LORE_2]": "Discordia looked beyond the earth and the rocks. She looked beyond the mortal planes altogether. She looked down into the Underworld, and the answers she found there were unlike anything her peers saw in the stars. She learnt the meaning of true power and she saw the risky path that leads most easily to it.",
  "[7600_LORE_3]": "Discordia made a pact with a Daemon - an ancient, powerful, and cunning creature named Astaroth, a thing of fire and hatred who had designs upon Krystara. He offered the power Discordia craved in exchange for being summoned to the mortal realm. ",
  "[7635_LORE_1]": "Crystalems are magical statues employed by the High Elves as guards, sentinels, and protectors. They can be found protecting treasures, sacred places, and even spots of natural beauty - after all, the last thing anyone wants is Goblins coming in and fouling the waters of your pristine glacial waterfalls.",
  "[7635_LORE_2]": "Beautiful in their own right, the wonder of Crystalems is that with a single spell, they can be set to guard a location for centuries. The problem with this is that sometimes - if a corrupting influence acts on the Crystalem - nobody is paying attention and the Crystalem can go rogue.",
  "[7635_LORE_3]": "It is not easy to corrupt a Crystalem - it is far beyond the reach of a Goblin Shaman, or even most Warlocks of Karakoth. It takes a truly malignant and powerful force, such as a Daemon King or Dead God to introduce the corruption. When it does take hold though, a Crystalem can become an uncontrolled killing machine.",
  "[7637_LORE_1]": "All throughout the northwest of Krystara, there are legends of Ivar Longclaw, the Urskayan Master of the Hunt. It all started when he was a young Urska cub, and he slew the Frostfang Wyrm high in the mountains by luring it into a collapsing cave.",
  "[7637_LORE_2]": "Not long after, he solved the mystery of the Crimson Forest by infiltrating a corrupt Druid’s lair. After facing off against the Druid’s monstrous companions, he tracked the Druid almost as far as the Glacial Peaks before he slew him with an arrow fired from half a mile away.",
  "[7637_LORE_3]": "More recently, Ivar is known for hunting the legendary Ghost Stag - a mystical creature that was said to grant immortality to whomever took its antlers. He hunted the beast for weeks, until he finally caught it with a cunning trap. Its antlers now rest over Ivar Longclaw’s hearth, but as for the myth… only time will tell if that is true.",
  "[7638_LORE_1]": "Krystara is full of predators - big ones, small ones, flying ones - even fluffy ones. This is a problem if you’re delicious and largely defenseless… like a goat, for example. It leads to rather large numbers of dead goats lying around, and unfortunately - in a world with necromancers - that leads to zombies… GOAT zombies.",
  "[7638_LORE_2]": "But why goats, you may ask. Why do necromancers raise the dead at all? Is it a compulsion, like needing to cough? **cough** Oops, I raised a goat again! Or is it a calling? A need to have as many dead things follow you around as possible, even, if it’s just a bunch of zombie goats? Nope! The truth is that it’s just practicality.",
  "[7638_LORE_3]": "Goats make GREAT zombies! Far more robust than a human zombie, goats are faster, more stable, and better at dealing with stairs. Goats eat anything too, so they never get distracted by brains! Overall while most folk might consider a necromancer with some goats to be a bit of a loser, the truth is that he’s one of the hip kids.",
  "[7640_LORE_1]": "Most Giants like to smash things. Even the fancy Storm Giants like to smash things with their lightning bolts. So it’s quite rare to find a Giant who likes to put things back together. Heldr is one such giant, but unfortunately the things she chose to put back together were… dead.",
  "[7640_LORE_2]": "To be fair, when Heldr first started necromancy she WAS smashing things. She had just uncovered a sealed tomb in which she found a dark tome filled with all sorts of secrets, and a number of intriguing diagrams. Fascinated by the epic depiction of revivification rituals, she set about studying the language it was written in.",
  "[7640_LORE_3]": "Before long, Heldr was making small zombies, but she soon progressed to larger things like huge rotting sea serpents. After eventually (some would say “inevitably”) raising a Grave Giant, she settled back down to building an army of smaller creatures. She now happily resides in the wilds of Stormheim with her 32 cats, 7 of which are actually mostly alive.",
  "[7641_LORE_1]": "Black-scaled Dragonians are usually rogues and thieves. Their dark matte scales help them sneak around in dark places and ensure they are seldom seen. Chargrimax however is dark-scaled Dragonian with a difference; not only are his scales shiny, but he is a mage.",
  "[7641_LORE_2]": "Chargrimax did not start life with black scales though. He was born red. Like all red Dragonians, he was trained in the arts of magic. As is common for his people, Chargrimax took an interest in fire magic. Not all Dragonian fire mages take to the field of battle though - some assist in the forges, others in the preparation of food. Chargrimax took a different path - he became an academic, studying the structure and performance of fiery spells.",
  "[7641_LORE_3]": "And it is here where Chargrimax acquired his unique appearance. While studying if the explosive force of a spell could be multiplied exponentially by the application of Goblin explosives, he accidentally ‘cooked’ himself. Lucky to survive, he was nursed back to health only to discover his scales had been charred beyond recovery.",
  "[7643_LORE_1]": "Sadly not all of the statues in Hellcrag were well-preserved over the centuries before being returned to life after the defeat of Czernobog. Some had broken, some had weathered away, but others - like the unfortunate Mudwalker - had just become… moist.",
  "[7643_LORE_2]": "As the rest of Hellcrag groaned back to life, the Mudwalker was slowly reforming - not in the way a person with a bad habit reforms, nor in the way a sinner might atone - he was literally RE-forming. It took a good 12 months for his slop to slowly glop back together to the point he could walk around.",
  "[7643_LORE_3]": "But now that he can move, the Mudwalker has proved very valuable to Hellcrag. He is ridiculously durable, and an excellent defender of the city. Other denizens might break when hit, but the Mudwalker simply absorbs a blow, and if a little bit of him gets sliced off… well, it’s nothing he didn’t experience for hundreds of years before… he just slaps it back on later.",
  "[7645_LORE_1]": "Fairy Dragons have powers related to the trees that birth them. The mightiest amongst them - the Mistmother - was born from the great Misty Rowan tree where Suna first appeared in the Bright Forest. But the sweet little Crackleleaf - with all her awkward twisty angles - was born from a plain old Maple.",
  "[7645_LORE_2]": "Unfortunately, Crackeleaf’s magical power was tied to a sneeze. If she drank too much maple sap, there would be an inevitable allergic reaction that would involve her shooting half the undigested sap out of her perky little nose. As if that wasn’t embarrassing enough, the sap would react with things in strange ways.",
  "[7645_LORE_3]": "Once, she accidentally sneezed on a dandelion and caused it to get so big it was dangerous. Her solution to sneeze on it again to shrink it back down, only caused it to explode and cover a 5-mile wide area in dandelion fluff. So, mostly Crackleleaf keeps to herself these days, traveling the wild and secret paths of the Bright Forest.",
  "[6065_LORE_1]": "The Lava Worms of the Broken Spire were first discovered by a Dwarven King - Firefist of Karak Lorgrim  - who disturbed them while he was digging for fire rubies. This probably would have been his headlining achievement, except that he also managed to disturb Infernus, and that was what really got everyone’s attention.",
  "[6065_LORE_2]": "Greatest of the Lava Worms though was Sheggra. Centuries old, she had spawned thousands of young wormlings over that time (or Pyggrae as they were better known). Many of those she devoured, but many more went on to become great Lava Worms in their own right - some even swam through the deep lava tunnels to inhabit volcanoes on the mainland.",
  "[6065_LORE_3]": "It was always rumored that the heart of a Lava Worm could melt the poison or disease from a mortal’s body. This was put to the test by General Luther - when his Queen was struck down by a potent poison, he traveled to Broken Spire, and cut out Sheggra’s heart to cure his beloved monarch. But Lava Worms have more than one heart…",
  "[6994_LORE_1]": "This should not be confused with a Dark GIN Bottle, even though the contents of either can leave you incapacitated. No, this particular Djinn Bottle contains a spirit of a very different kind - either a Djinn, Ifrit, or Dao from the old Maraji Empire. They may be called forth from the bottle by rubbing it.",
  "[6994_LORE_2]": "Legends say that any creature summed from such a bottle owes you three wishes, but that isn’t quite true - it depends on the spell binding the creature there. Some may certainly grant wishes within their powers, but others may be bound to protect you from harm 3 times, or even to DO harm to you three times.",
  "[6994_LORE_3]": "Fortunately most of the summoned Djinn, Ifrit, and Dao are friendly and will perform their task in a good natured fashion, then depart back into the bottle which will immediately disappear, only to appear miles away, awaiting their new owner.",
  "[7647_LORE_1]": "All manner of Warlocks are drawn to Karakoth - the chance to uncover Eldritch secrets is just too much for them to resist. They come, and they stay - sometimes for their whole life… and sometimes beyond that! Draxxius was one good example of a Warlock-turned-Liche who stayed beyond his welcome. Abraxas is another…",
  "[7647_LORE_2]": "Abraxas’ particular specialty is Souls. Originally from the kingdom of Khetar, his apprenticeship was to a monstrous Necromancer, who taught him how to rip a soul from a body, how to devour that soul, and how to extract metaphysical nutrients from it. Abraxas’ time in Karakoth was spent learning how to do all of these things… to HIMSELF.",
  "[7647_LORE_3]": "Once in Liche form, Abraxas set about gathering more secrets of soul magic. He learned how to rip the Souls from many creatures at once, and how to use the inherent power-release of a broken soul to destroy anything that stands in his way. These two abilities have given him an unsettling interest in siege warfare.",
  "[7648_LORE_1]": "The Healers of the Forest of Thorns are renowned throughout Krystara for their patience, dedication, and skill. They are fortunate to be led by the noble Lady Florella, second cousin of King Avelorn, and a true master of the arts of natural healing.",
  "[7648_LORE_2]": "Lady Florella, lives in an arboreal palace, less than a day’s ride from the King. Here, the grounds span 10 acres, and contain all manner of plant, herb, tree, and vine with a variety of healing properties. Powerful magic protects this garden, and not even a single marauding Dandylion can sneak inside. ",
  "[7648_LORE_3]": "Of Florella’s plants, the Healing Vines are probably the most famous; they are able to attune themselves to a patient and will entirely heal their wounds and fill them with vigor, but only if the patient is pure of heart.  Other famous plants include the Golden Lavender - said to be able to calm a rampaging Dragon - and her Spicy Ginger, which can even cure a common cold.",
  "[7660_LORE_1]": "There comes a time in every young Dwarf’s life where he has to decide: Do I eat the Ram? Or do I ride the Ram? Most Dwarves opt for a hearty meal, but not Dugall - he was made of sterner stuff. Not only did he ride the Ram, but he ripped off one of its horns, charged at a group of giants, and became a legend.",
  "[7660_LORE_2]": "Dugall’s first Ram never survived that fateful day - by the time Dugall emerged, covered in the blood of his foes, the Ram was long gone - half-hornless and buried beneath a pile of Giant carcasses. But Rams are plentiful, and Dugall soon found another, and another, and another... ",
  "[7660_LORE_3]": "Today Dugall is on his 57th Ram. They don’t have high life expectancy - neither does Dugall for that matter, although he continues to defy the odds. He still keeps the horn from his first Ram though - it never had a name - none of them do. Why get attached when tomorrow you’ll likely be crashing it headlong yet another group of foes.",
  "[7664_LORE_1]": "Not all Giants are the children of Giants, some are the children of men, born with a curse, who cannot stop growing; Scoria was one such child. They are known as the Giant-born. Scoria was raised in the southern reaches of Whitehelm, but his mother had been cursed by a witch while he was still in the womb. By the time Scoria was four years old, he was as tall as a man.",
  "[7664_LORE_2]": "Needless to say, although they grow fast, and are strong. Life for the Giant-born is not easy. Scoria was stoned and chased from the village, when the other folk learned what he was. He never returned. For most Giant-born, they live a feral existence in the wilderness, and become wild and violent like the Firbolg.",
  "[7664_LORE_3]": "Scoria was lucky though - a kindly old elven Druid named Elspeth found him on the edge of the Forest of Thorns, and raised him as if he were her own. Scoria studied hard, and grew very wise. In his thirtieth year, Elspeth passed away, so Scoria began traveling and learning about the world, eventually coming to rest on the Broken Spire, where the Giants there accepted him as one of their own.",
  "[7665_LORE_1]": "There are many orders of Knights in Sword’s Edge, some of them have history going back centuries, such as the Knights Coronet, while others are more recent, such as the Wolf Knights. The MOST recent order of Knights was created by Queen Ysabelle, and they are called the Seaborn Knights.",
  "[7665_LORE_2]": "The coast of Sword’s Edge is a dangerous place. Notwithstanding raids from Blackhawk, and the inevitable smuggling operations, the last few years have seen a rise in Sea Serpents, along with strange eldritch creatures and even Undead. A solution was needed, and thus the Seaborn Knights were… ah… born…",
  "[7665_LORE_3]": "Rather than being mounted on griffons or horses, each squad of Seaborn Knights has a ship, named after one of the ancient kings or queens of Sword’s Edge. In their first few years as a new order, under the command of Sir Redric Shorrington, these knights have already earned their place amongst the finest warriors in their kingdom.",
  "[6248_LORE_1]": "The Inquisitors of Whitehelm were established millennia ago, after Whitehelm’s split from the Empire of Adania, as a way to protect the church against corruption. Unfortunately, they have not always been as successful as their founders hoped.",
  "[6248_LORE_2]": "So, 3 centuries past, the Grand Inquisitors were established - a group of vicious fanatics bent on rooting out corruption in their own order. Nicknamed the “Toe-Cutters” (for a reason), their motto has been “No matter how many innocent people die, no guilty man should go free”.",
  "[6248_LORE_3]": "Unfortunately, history repeated itself with the rise of Moloch. This time the Grand Inquisitors were compromised, and had it not been for their unwarranted attacks on the lands of Lady Sapphira, and the timely intervention of our hero, the corruption may very well have spread through Whitehelm.",
  "[7667_LORE_1]": "Nothing in Nexus works the same way it does in the regular lands of Krystara - the native folk are made up of the 4 elements (6 if you count the variations of the Umbral Nexus). So it makes sense that even their siege equipment is different. Such is the Tempest Ballista.",
  "[7667_LORE_2]": "Where an ordinary ballista shoots huge wooden bolts that can pierce a Dwarven Gate, a Tempest Ballista shoots pure elemental energy. These bolts, in particular, are filled with the power of a storm, full of lightning, thunder and raging fury - it makes sense, as an ordinary ballista would just pass through elemental structures.",
  "[7667_LORE_3]": "Where the Tempest Ballista comes in handy in Krystara is the water. Lightning and water have always been a dangerous mix, but as Khnedrik the Fisherdwarf noted when he got his hands on one - if you want to catch a lot of fish quickly, the only thing better than a net is a well-aimed Tempest Ballista.",
  "[7668_LORE_1]": "The Pridelands can be a dangerous place for the inexperienced and unwary. Huge Behemoths roam the barren center, along with things that are powerful enough to have evolved in a land inhabited by the feral Raksha. To travel here, you need to be string, or you need to have a guide who knows where you can walk - a Pridestalker.",
  "[7668_LORE_2]": "It is said that Pridestalkers do not choose their vocation - instead, it chooses them. Some Raksha are filled with wanderlust. This is not the type of wanderlust that drives them to travel in search of great foes to slay, as proof of their prowess. No, THIS wanderlust is about the journey, not the destination.",
  "[7668_LORE_3]": "By the time they come of age, if a Raksha has already crossed the Pridelands from north to south, and west to east, they know they are a Pridestalker. There is no training, they simply leave their village or tribe and head out into the wilds. Merchants, travelers, or other tribes will seek one out if they need to cross unfamiliar territory.",
  "[6358_LORE_1]": "The two daughters of Orion - Artema and Anthea - are as different as night and day. Anthea is the younger daughter - a lover of nature, often seen running wild and free - while Artema is the older, always in search of battle.",
  "[6358_LORE_2]": "Anthea enjoys the smell of the trees, and the feel of the long grass as it brushes against her fetlocks. Upon occasion, in Spring, she will visit small tribal villages, bearing herbal blooms and medicinal plants, which she gives away freely to all in need.",
  "[6358_LORE_3]": "Artema thinks her foolish - she loves war instead. Seldom seen without a lance in her hands, the local tribes shy away from her, believing it is bad luck if she crosses their path. Unlike Anthea, when Artema enters your village, it is to recruit warriors, and they are seldom seen again!",

While mixing a potion of youth for one of the noble ladies, she accidentally added the wrong ingredient, transforming her patron into a heaving mass of green entrails. Mirelda was destined to become the first Toxic Hag.",
  "[7670_LORE_2]": "Sentenced to death for her carelessness, Mirelda used a secret concoction to melt the bars of her jail cell and escape. She made her way to the northern shores of Darkstone, where she gradually started her new life, embracing the toxic elements she could add to her craft.",
  "[7670_LORE_3]": "Mirelda eventually passed away, but her apprentices carried on the traditions, two by two, in a line unbroken. Today the Toxic Hags  are recognized and lauded for their craft. Their potions have many applications, from curses to cleansing. Like the other Hags, they are not part of the Darkstone nobility, but are frequently employed by them.",

As usual it was overly dramatic, tied with a red ribbon to the leg of a disgruntled-looking raven. \\n\\nApparently Daemons had recently been seen in Maugrim Woods. Again...  It's always Daemons... It was nothing the Wargare couldn't handle for now, but Scarlett was concerned there may be a problem like before, with a portal opening somewhere, and no Kerberos to guard it. \\n\\nI set for Maugrim Woods immediately, to see what was happening.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE01]": "This wasn't like before with the Daemons.  This invasion felt different - darker and angrier somehow.  Scarlett wasn't certain, but I thought it worth traveling to Ghulvania to see what I could learn. \\n\\nThere was a Vampire Hunter down there - an old acquaintance of Avina's - his name was Van Kane.  If anybody would know what the Undead Lords of Ghulvania were up to, it would be him.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE02]": "While we certainly helped Van Kane kill a lot of Vampires, we learned nothing about the troubles in Maugrim Woods. \\n\\nWe were on our way back there, when we happened upon a Sapphire Knight - one of the Royal Guard of Silverglade. As it turned out, he was looking for us. \\n\\nDaemons had now been spotted in Silverglade too, but these Daemons were not known to the High Elves - they were cloaked in darkness and shadow, and filled with rage. \\n\\nWe accompanied him back to his homeland to help the kingdom, and see what we could learn.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE03]": "These Shades were unstoppable. Every time we slew one, two more would take its place. \\n\\nThe King tasked us with seeking out some help from his kinsfolk, the Wood Elves of Silverglade.  As time was of the essence, Krystenax, the royal dragon, agreed to take some time away from the defense of the Kingdom and fly us down there to meet one Lord Belanor - a long time friend and ally of Silverglade. \\n\\nKrystara isn't a quiet place at the best of times - this was no exception. The Wood Elves faced troubles of their own with Elementals from the Primal Rift.  I agreed to help them in exchange for some of Belanor's troops being sent to Silverglade.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE04]": "With the Elementals taken care of, we prepared to head back north.  But things just kept getting worse and worse... \\n\\nAs we were preparing to leave, Tassarion sent us a magical missive. He was still engaged in his studies in the Glacial Peaks, but had seen these Daemonic Shades creating fortifications there - preparing an assault on the Winter Court of Queen Mab. He bid us seek out Cernunnos, a solitary Fey warrior, who could show us where the towers were. \\n\\nIt seemed these creatures were hell-bent (see what I did there) on invading the entire northern lands.  Forewarned this time, we quickly headed north, hoping to provide assistance before things got grim.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE05]": "With Cernunnos' help, Glacial Peaks was saved for now, but up until this time we had been entirely reactive to the Daemonic threat. \\n\\nWe needed to get on the front foot, and learn more about what was going on here.  With that in mind, I set out to talk with the Pandaska Mages of Shentang - they had some experience in long drawn out battles with Daemons after all. \\n\\nIt seemed that plan have been a little predictable though, as when we landed on the Southwilde, we found the Daemons had stirred up the Tauros to slow us down.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE06]": "The Pandaska seldom disappoint - they had a name for me... Kurandara. \\n\\nMore importantly, they knew who this Kurandara was - an ancient Daemon Lord who had been defeated in Urskaya many centuries ago.  It seemed he was back, seeking revenge against the children of Doomclaw. \\n\\nThey knew nothing of his weaknesses though, but suggested we set out for the broken lands of Karakoth, where the Keepers of Lore may be convinced to summon a Daemon or three, to learn more about how we might defeat this Kurandara.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE07]": "The Keepers of Lore came through.  It seemed we needed two things to stop Kurandara, but neither would be easy to obtain - a Daemonic Keystone, and a Daemonic Lockstone. What better to shut a portal after all than a lock and a key! \\n\\nIt seemed the Orcs in Grosh-Nak had a Lockstone, but I hated dealing with Orcs. I decided to set out in search of one of the Infernal King's Heralds - they'd proved good allies in the past.  Perhaps together we could get the Lockstone from the Orcs.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE08]": "With the Daemonic Lockstone in our possession, we set out after a Keystone.  We traveled for many days towards the Sin of Maraj, in search of a man called Gael Spiritwhisperer. They'd told me his name in Karakoth - he had traveled into Maraj to study the Underworld. \\n\\nWhy did we need his help, you ask?  Well, the problem was that the only known Keystone was in the hands of the vile Daemonic Artificer, Tartarus.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE09]": "With both Lockstone and Keystone in our possession we headed back north, ready to search for and finally close the portal through which Kurandara's minions had been entering the world. \\n\\nPrince Barislav, son of King Mikhail, received word of our coming and met us at the border.  It seemed that any rift I had with the Urska had been temporarily forgiven as we prepared to face the Daemon Lord himself.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30000_LORE10]": "It was done. Just as Doomclaw had managed long ago, we sealed Kurandara's portal.  The battles would continue for a while - mopping up any of the remaining Daemonic forces, but the war had finally been won.",

Left unchecked, the Orcs sometimes get themselves into a lot of strife, so Dark Song asked if we could make our way there and help calm things down. \\n\\nOf course, the best way to stop Orcs fighting was... you guessed it... fighting them. Some things only make sense in Grosh-Nak.",

It had accurately been named the Werebat, as its bite could transform a victim into a beast. We resolved to investigate.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE01]": "The Werebats were real! But we had no idea of their origin. I suggested that we travel into the Underworld and speak with Master Torbern - he was an expert on such things.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE02]": "All Master Torbern could tell us was that these new were-creatures were nothing like his kin in the Werewoods - there were darker forces at work here. Tassarion suggested we visit the library  he had been gathering in his old home in the Glacial Peaks, near where we first met him.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE03]": "Grimmoira, Tassarion's personal librarian, showed us a book about the Moon Deities, Hatir and Skroll - the black and white wolves who chased the moon and sun through the sky. Her opinion, which Tassarion quickly claimed as his own, was that there may be an imbalance favouring Hatir, and the moon was somehow creating these creatures. Our next stop would be Adana, to visit the Great Observatory.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE04]": "At the Great Observatory the researchers could clearly see that the moon appeared larger than normal. This confirmed Grimmoria's theory that Hatir had somehow thrown off the balance - perhaps it all originated from the time when the Sun vanished last year. We headed towards the Forest of Thorns to talk with the Earth Dreamers; we would see if they had any wisdom to share.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE05]": "The Earth Dreamers told us that we would need to do two things to solve our problem. Create a potion to cure the lycanthropy, AND confront Hatir in his home of Maugrim Woods to restore the balance. We headed to the Mist of Scales for the first potion ingredient: Wererat Blood.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE06]": "Why Wererat Blood? Apparently the potion could only be created with ingredients from old were-creatures - ones that existed before the imbalance. With some of that in our possession, we headed towards Suncrest in search of the second potion ingredient, Swanmay Feathers - only obtainable from an ancient were-creature, the Swanmay.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE07]": "All the ingredients were ours. Unfortunately, we would require the assistance of Darkstone's Potion Masters to create this magical elixir. They were an unsavoury bunch, but desperate times require desperate measures, or so they say.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE08]": "The potion had been created, now all we had to do was reach Maugrim Woods and confront Hatir. The quickest way was by sea, so we took a fast boat that would sail via Merlantis straight to Maugrim Woods.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE09]": "The trip would have been easier had we not encountered Weresharks off the coast of Blackhawk. With them behind us though, we continued on our way to Maugrim Woods. Scarlett sent word ahead to her people in the Crimson Order - at least we would have some help when we arrived.",
  "[ARTIFACT_30004_LORE10]": "It was done! Hatir had been defeated, and balance had been restored between th Sun and the Moon - hopefully for good this time. We set out from Maugrim Woods, also hopeful that there would be fewer were-creatures around now.",
