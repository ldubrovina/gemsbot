The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel
free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How can I contribute?
### Reporting bugs
 * **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
 * **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining which command you entered, or how you tried inviting the bot. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. 
 * **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
 * **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
 * **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
 * **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

Provide more context by answering these questions:
 * **Can you reproduce the problem in other servers or channels**?
 * **Did the problem start happening recently**?
 * **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:
 * **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
 * **Which language setting are you using**?
